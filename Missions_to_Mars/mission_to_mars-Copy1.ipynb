Plans call for the TGO to use its Electra radios for communication with ESA's 2018 ExoMars Rover and Russia's Lander as well as with NASA's 2016 Mars lander and 2020 Mars rover.

      "\n",
      "<p>Orbital observations of the site by another NASA spacecraft, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, found a spectrum with the signature of aluminum bound to oxygen and hydrogen. Researchers regard that signature as a marker for a mineral called montmorillonite, which is in a class of clay minerals called smectites. Montmorillonite forms when basalt is altered under wet and slightly acidic conditions. The exposure of it extends about 800 feet (about 240 meters) north to south on the western rim of Endeavour Crater, as mapped by the orbiter's Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"It's like a mineral beacon visible from orbit saying, 'Come check this out,'\" said Opportunity Principal Investigator Steve Squyres, of Cornell University, Ithaca, New York.  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Some of the most important findings from Opportunity's long mission came from combining CRISM and rover observations of a site about 2 miles (3 kilometers) farther north on the crater's western rim. Rocks exposed there contain evidence for an iron-bearing smectite - called nontronite -- as well as for montmorillonite. That site yielded evidence for an ancient environment with water that would have been well-suited for use by microbes, if Mars had any billions of years ago. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Evidence that Opportunity may add about the geological context for different smectites could boost understanding about diversity and changes in ancient wet environments on Mars.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Opportunity reached the northern end of the montmorillonite-bearing exposure last month, at a high spot called \"Pillinger Point.\" Opportunity's international science team chose that informal name in honor of Colin Pillinger (1943-2014). Pillinger was the British principal investigator for the Beagle 2 project, which attempted to set a research lander on Mars a few weeks before Opportunity's January 2004 landing.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Colin and his team were trying to get to Mars at the same time that we were, and in some ways they faced even greater challenges than we did,\" Squyres said. \"Our team has always had enormous respect for the energy and enthusiasm with which Colin Pillinger undertook the Beagle 2 mission. He will be missed.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>Initial measurements at this site with the element-identifying alpha particle X-ray spectrometer at the end of Opportunity's arm indicate that bright-toned veins in the rock contain calcium sulfate. Scientists deduce this mineral was deposited as water moved through fractures on Endeavour's rim. The rover earlier found veins of calcium sulfate farther north along the rim. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>As Opportunity investigates this site and sites farther south along the rim, the rover has more energy than usual.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The solar panels have not been this clean since the first year of the mission,\" said Opportunity Project Manager John Callas of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. \"It's amazing, when you consider that accumulation of dust on the solar panels was originally expected to cause the end of the mission in less than a year. Now it's as if we'd been a ship out at sea for 10 years and just picked up new provisions at a port of call, topping off our supplies.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Both Opportunity and its rover twin, Spirit, benefited from sporadic dust-cleaning events in past years. However, on the ridge that Opportunity has been navigating since late 2013, winds have removed dust more steadily, day by day, than either rover has experienced elsewhere.  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"It's easy to forget that Opportunity is in the middle of a Martian winter right now,\" said JPL's Jennifer Herman, power-subsystem engineer. \"Because of the clean solar arrays, clear skies and favorable tilt, there is more energy for operations now than there was any time during the previous three Martian summers. Opportunity is now able to pull scientific all-nighters for three nights in a row -- something she hasn't had the energy to do in years.\"\n",

Nearby, at an area known as Yellowknife Bay, the mission met its main goal of determining whether the Martian Gale Crater ever was habitable for simple life forms. The answer, a historic \"yes,\" came from two mudstone slabs that the rover sampled with its drill. Analysis of these samples revealed the site was once a lakebed with mild water, the essential elemental ingredients for life, and a type of chemical energy source used by some microbes on Earth.

      "\n",
      "<p>\"Windjana has more magnetite than previous samples we've analyzed,\" said David Blake, principal investigator for Curiosity's Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instrument at NASA's Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California.  \"A key question is whether this magnetite is a component of the original basalt or resulted from later processes, such as would happen in water-soaked basaltic sediments. The answer is important to our understanding of habitability and the nature of the early-Mars environment.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Preliminary indications are that the rock contains a more diverse mix of clay minerals than was found in the mission's only previously drilled rocks, the mudstone targets at Yellowknife Bay. Windjana also contains an unexpectedly high amount of the mineral orthoclase, a potassium-rich feldspar that is one of the most abundant minerals in Earth's crust that had never before been definitively detected on Mars. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This finding implies that some rocks on the Gale Crater rim, from which the Windjana sandstones are thought to have been derived, may have experienced complex geological processing, such as multiple episodes of melting. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"It's too early for conclusions, but we expect the results to help us connect what we learned at Yellowknife Bay to what we'll learn at Mount Sharp,\" said John Grotzinger, Curiosity project scientist at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena. \"Windjana is still within an area where a river flowed. We see signs of a complex history of interaction between water and rock.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity departed Windjana in mid-May and is advancing westward. It has covered about nine-tenths of a mile (1.5 kilometers) in 23 driving days and brought the mission's odometer tally up to 4.9 miles (7.9 kilometers).  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Since wheel damage prompted a slow-down in driving late in 2013, the mission team has adjusted routes and driving methods to reduce the rate of damage. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>For example, the mission team revised the planned route to future destinations on the lower slope of an area called Mount Sharp, where scientists expect geological layering will yield answers about ancient environments. Before Curiosity landed, scientists anticipated that the rover would need to reach Mount Sharp to meet the goal of determining whether the ancient environment was favorable for life. They found an answer much closer to the landing site. The findings so far have raised the bar for the work ahead. At Mount Sharp, the mission team will seek evidence not only of habitability, but also of how environments evolved and what conditions favored preservation of clues to whether life existed there.</p>\n",

      "</div>In late May, NASA's Swift satellite imaged comet Siding Spring, which will brush astonishingly close to Mars later this year. These optical and ultraviolet observations are the first to reveal how rapidly the comet is producing water and allow astronomers to better estimate its size. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Comet Siding Spring is making its first passage through the inner solar system and is experiencing its first strong heating from the sun,\" said lead researcher Dennis Bodewits, an astronomer at the University of Maryland College Park (UMCP). \"These observations are part of a two-year-long Swift campaign to watch how the comet's activity develops during its travels.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Fresh\" comets like Siding Spring, which is formally known as C/2013 A1, contain some of the most ancient material scientists can study. The solid part of a comet, called its nucleus, is a clump of frozen gases mixed with dust and is often described as a \"dirty snowball.\" Comets cast off gas and dust whenever they venture near enough to the sun.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>What powers this activity is the transformation of frozen material from solid ice to gas, a process called sublimation. As the comet approaches the sun and becomes heated, different gases stream from the nucleus, carrying with them large quantities of dust that reflect sunlight and brighten the comet. By about two and a half times Earth's distance from the sun (2.5 astronomical units, or AU), the comet has warmed enough that water becomes the primary gas emitted by the nucleus.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Between May 27 and 29, Swift's Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) captured a sequence of images as comet Siding Spring cruised through the constellation Eridanus at a distance of about 2.46 AU (229 million miles or 368 million km) from the sun. While the UVOT cannot detect water molecules directly, it can detect light emitted by fragments formed when ultraviolet sunlight breaks up water -- specifically, hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl (OH) molecules.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Based on our observations, we calculate that at the time of the observations the comet was producing about 2 billion billion billion water molecules, equivalent to about 13 gallons or 49 liters, each second,\" said team member Tony Farnham, a senior research scientist at UMCP. At this rate, comet Siding Spring could fill an Olympic-size swimming pool in about 14 hours. Impressive as it sounds, though, this is relatively modest water emission compared to other comets Swift has observed.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Based on these measurements, the team concludes that the icy nucleus of comet Siding Spring is only about 2,300 feet (700 meters) across, placing it at the lower end of a size range estimated from earlier observations by other spacecraft.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The comet makes its closest approach to Mars on Oct. 19, passing just 86,000 miles (138,000 km) from the Red Planet -- so close that gas and dust in the outermost reaches of the comet's atmosphere, or coma, will interact with the atmosphere of Mars.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>For comparison, the closest recorded Earth approach by a comet was by the now-defunct comet Lexell, which on July 1, 1770, swept to within 1.4 million miles (2.3 million km) or about six times farther than the moon. During its Mars flyby, comet Siding Spring will pass more than 16 times closer than this.  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Scientists have established that the comet poses no danger to spacecraft now in orbit around Mars. These missions will be pressed into service as a provisional comet observation fleet to take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Swift observations are part of a larger study to investigate the activity and evolution of new comets, which show distinct brightening characteristics as they approach the sun not seen in other comets. Bodewits and his colleagues single out comets that can be observed by Swift at distances where water has not yet become the primary gas and repeatedly observe them as they course through the inner solar system. This systematic study will help astronomers better understand how comet activity changes with repeated solar heating.</p>\n",

The project's reserved time at the range will expire Saturday, June 14, with NASA unable to fly the test because of continuing unfavorable weather conditions. <br /><br />Mark Adler, the Low Density Supersonic Decelerator project manager and Ian Clark, principal investigator on the project, both from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, participated in a media teleconference this morning and addressed questions on the project.  <br /><br />\"There were six total opportunities to test the vehicle, and the delay of all six opportunities was caused by weather,\" said Adler. \"We needed the mid-level winds between 15,000 and 60,000 feet to take the balloon away from the island. While there were a few days that were very close, none of the days had the proper wind conditions.\" <br /><br />The team had researched for more than two years wind conditions and locations around the world that would be conducive to the test. Kauai was selected because research showed that this area had the proper wind conditions to carry the balloon away from populated areas and where it needed to go over the ocean in order to launch the test vehicle. Recent weather conditions have been unexpected and have caused unacceptable wind conditions to launch the balloon. <br /><br />NASA continues to look at options for a future launch window. The team is working with the Pacific Missile Range Facility and looking at weather conditions predicted for later in the month when another launch window could be possible. <br /><br />\"Our team has been working on this project for several years, and we have been so focused,\" said Clark. \"We came here to do our job and get this vehicle off the ground, but unfortunately weather didn't allow us to do this. We are very optimistic and are hoping to test the vehicle at the end of the month.\" <br /><br />NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate in Washington funds the LDSD mission, a cooperative effort led by JPL. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, manages LDSD within the Technology Demonstration Mission Program Office.

      "<p>NASA's flying saucer-shaped test vehicle is ready to take to the skies from the U.S. Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, Hawaii, for its first engineering shakeout flight. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The first launch opportunity for the test vehicle is June 3, when the launch window opens at 8:30 a.m. Hawaii Standard Time (11:30 a.m. PDT/2:30 p.m. EDT). The test will be carried live on NASA TV and streamed on the Web. The Low Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD) will gather data about landing heavy payloads on Mars and other planetary surfaces.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The agency is moving forward and getting ready for Mars as part of NASA's Evolvable Mars campaign,\" said Michael Gazarik, associate administrator for Space Technology at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"We fly, we learn, we fly again. We have two more vehicles in the works for next year.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>As NASA plans increasingly ambitious robotic missions to Mars, laying the groundwork for even more complex human science expeditions to come, accommodating extended stays for explorers on the Martian surface will require larger and heavier spacecraft. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The objective of the LDSD project is to see if the cutting-edge, rocket-powered test vehicle operates as it was designed -- in near-space at high Mach numbers. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"After years of imagination, engineering and hard work, we soon will get to see our Keiki o ka honua, our 'boy from Earth,' show us its stuff,\" said Mark Adler, project manager for the Low Density Supersonic Decelerator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"The success of this experimental test flight will be measured by the success of the test vehicle to launch and fly its flight profile as advertised. If our flying saucer hits its speed and altitude targets, it will be a great day.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The way NASA's saucer climbs to test altitude is almost as distinctive as the test vehicle itself.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We use a helium balloon -- that, when fully inflated, would fit snugly into Pasadena's Rose Bowl -- to lift our vehicle to 120,000 feet,\" said Adler. \"From there we drop it for about one-and-a-half seconds. After that, it's all about going higher and faster -- and then it's about putting on the brakes.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A fraction of a second after dropping from the balloon, and a few feet below it, four small rocket motors will fire to spin up and gyroscopically stabilize the saucer. A half second later, a Star 48B long-nozzle, solid-fueled rocket engine will kick in with 17,500 pounds of thrust, sending the test vehicle to the edge of the stratosphere.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Our goal is to get to an altitude and velocity which simulates the kind of environment one of our vehicles would encounter when it would fly in the Martian atmosphere,\" said Ian Clark, principal investigator of the LDSD project at JPL. \"We top out at about 180,000 feet and Mach 4. Then, as we slow down to Mach 3.8, we deploy the first of two new atmospheric braking systems.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The project management team decided also to fly the two supersonic decelerator technologies that will be thoroughly tested during two LDSD flight tests next year. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>If this year's test vehicle flies as expected, the LDSD team may get a treasure-trove of data on how the approximately 20-foot (6-meter) supersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerator (SIAD-R) and the supersonic parachute operate a full year ahead of schedule.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The SIAD-R, essentially an inflatable doughnut that increases the vehicle's size and, as a result, its drag, is deployed at about Mach 3.8. It will quickly slow the vehicle to Mach 2.5 where the parachute, the largest supersonic parachute ever flown, first hits the supersonic flow. About 45 minutes later, the saucer is expected to make a controlled landing onto the Pacific Ocean off Hawaii.</p>\n",

      "</div>NASA and its international partners now have the go-ahead to begin construction on a new Mars lander, after it completed a successful Mission Critical Design Review on Friday.\r\n",
      "<br /> \r\n",
      "<br />NASA's Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) mission will pierce beneath the Martian surface to study its interior. The mission will investigate how Earth-like planets formed and developed their layered inner structure of core, mantle and crust, and will collect information about those interior zones using instruments never before used on Mars.\r\n",
      "<br /> \r\n",
      "<br />InSight will launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base, on the central California coast near Lompoc, in March 2016. This will be the first interplanetary mission ever to launch from California. The mission will help inform the agency's goal of sending a human mission to Mars in the 2030s.\r\n",
      "<br /> \r\n",
      "<br />InSight team leaders presented mission design results last week to a NASA review board, which then gave approval for advancing to the next stage of preparation.\r\n",
      "<br /> \r\n",
      "<br />\"Our partners across the globe have made significant progress in getting to this point and are fully prepared to deliver their hardware to system integration starting this November, which is the next major milestone for the project,\" said Tom Hoffman, InSight project manager of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. \"We now move from doing the design and analysis to building and testing the hardware and software that will get us to Mars and collect the science that we need to achieve mission success.\"\r\n",
      "<br /> \r\n",
      "<br />To investigate the planet's interior, the stationary lander will carry a robotic arm that will deploy surface and burrowing instruments contributed by France and Germany. The national space agencies of France and Germany -- Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) -- are partnering with NASA by providing InSight's two main science instruments.\r\n",
      "<br /> \r\n",
      "<br />The Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) will be built by CNES in partnership with DLR and the space agencies of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It will measure waves of ground motion carried through the interior of the planet, from \"marsquakes\" and meteor impacts. The Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, from DLR, will measure heat coming toward the surface from the planet's interior.\r\n",
      "<br /> \r\n",
      "<br />\"Mars actually offers an advantage over Earth itself for understanding how habitable planetary surfaces can form,\" said Bruce Banerdt, InSight principal investigator from JPL. \"Both planets underwent the same early processes. But Mars, being smaller, cooled faster and became less active while Earth kept churning. So Mars better preserves the evidence about the early stages of rocky planets' development.\"\r\n",
      "<br /> \r\n",
      "<br />The three-legged lander will go to a site near the Martian equator and provide information for a planned mission length of 720 days -- about two years. InSight adapts a design from the successful NASA Phoenix Mars Lander, which examined ice and soil on far-northern Mars in 2008.\r\n",
      "<br /> \r\n",
      "<br />\"We will incorporate many features from our Phoenix spacecraft into InSight, but the differences between the missions require some differences in the InSight spacecraft,\" said InSight Program Manager Stu Spath of Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, Denver. \"For example, the InSight mission duration is 630 days longer than Phoenix, which means the lander will have to endure a wider range of environmental conditions on the surface.\"\r\n",
      "<br /> \r\n",
      "<br />Guided by images of the surroundings taken by the lander, InSight's robotic arm will place the seismometer on the surface and then place a protective covering over it to minimize effects of wind and temperature on the sensitive instrument. The arm will also put the heat-flow probe in position to hammer itself into the ground to a depth of 3 to 5 yards, or meters.\r\n",
      "<br /> \r\n",
      "<br />Another experiment will use the radio link between InSight and NASA's Deep Space Network antennas on Earth to precisely measure a wobble in Mars' rotation that could reveal whether Mars has a molten or solid core. Wind and temperature sensors from Spain's Centro de Astrobiologia and a pressure sensor will monitor weather at the landing site, and a magnetometer will measure magnetic disturbances caused by the Martian ionosphere.\r\n",
      "<br /> \r\n",
      "<br />InSight's international science team is made up of researchers from Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. JPL manages InSight for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. InSight is part of NASA's Discovery Program of competitively selected missions. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, manages the Discovery Program. Lockheed Martin will build the lander and other parts of the spacecraft at its Littleton, Colorado, facility near Denver.\r\n",

      "</figcaption>\n",
      "</figure>\n",
      "</div>This past November, NASA launched the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission in the hope of understanding how and why the planet has been losing its atmosphere over billions of years. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>One instrument aboard the spacecraft will study a special component of the Martian atmosphere to help solve this mystery. By studying ions, or small electrically charged particles, in and above the Red Planet's tenuous atmosphere, the Solar Wind Ion Analyzer will help answer why Mars has gradually lost much of its atmosphere, developing into a frozen, barren planet.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Once the MAVEN spacecraft is orbiting Mars, the Solar Wind Ion Analyzer (SWIA)-which was designed and built at the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory (SSL)-will spend much of its time measuring the ions in the solar wind. Released continuously from the sun's atmosphere, the solar wind travels toward Mars at speeds around a million miles per hour, carrying with it a magnetic field that originates inside the sun. It is composed of charged particles that interact with neutral gas particles in Mars' upper atmosphere, giving them the ability to escape from Mars' gravitational pull.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Scientists think the interactions between solar wind ions and Mars' atmospheric particles are a key factor allowing the particles to escape, a process that gradually strips the planet of its atmosphere and has done so for billions of years.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>SWIA instrument lead Jasper Halekas of SSL said scientists could apply SWIA's measurements of solar wind ions with the measurements of the atmosphere's escaping gases the mission's other instruments make, making connections between the two that will paint the picture of how the atmosphere has evolved.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"By combining SWIA measurements with measurements of escaping gases we can parameterize the loss of atmospheric gases from Mars as a function of solar wind conditions,\" Halekas said. \"Ultimately, we want to know where the atmosphere, especially water, went, how it left, and what Mars has looked like over its entire history.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>SWIA will specifically be measuring the solar wind speed and density, two critical factors that determine how its ions interact with the planet's atmospheric particles. Halekas said although the solar wind itself isn't packed with ions, its blazing speed ensures that a huge number of ions are hitting the Martian atmosphere, and interacting with the atmosphere's particles, every second.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>MAVEN deputy principle investigator Janet Luhmann, also at SSL, said by measuring the solar wind's density and velocity, SWIA could help determine whether gusts of denser, faster solar wind contribute to greater atmospheric loss. This information will be used to estimate losses in the past, when solar wind gusts may have been prevalent thanks to an early, more active sun.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Once they hit the planet's atmosphere, the solar wind's ions play several critical roles in aiding particles to escape from Mars' atmosphere. The solar wind is made up of both electrons, which are very small, negatively charged particles, and ions, which are larger positively charged particles like ionized hydrogen and helium.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Halekas said both ions and electrons could start the process of particle escape by transforming the atmosphere's neutral particles into charged ions. This can occur through processes called charge exchange and impact ionization. Ultraviolet sunlight also transforms many atmospheric particles into ions. Once the atmospheric particles become charged, they can interact with the solar wind's magnetic field and be accelerated and carried away from the planet; ions that have been removed like this are called pickup ions. The ionization step is critical, since the original neutral particles don't respond to the solar wind magnetic field and generally have too little energy to escape.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Halekas said although the solar wind electrons contribute to particle escape by stripping electrons from some of the neutral atmospheric particles, it's the solar wind ions that play the more critical role in giving the particles enough energy to escape.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The ionized gases in the solar wind-known as plasma-can interact with the wind's magnetic field to form an electric field, and accelerate the newly charged particles in the atmosphere with enough energy for them to escape. While both the electrons and ions form this plasma, Halekas said the ions are in some ways more important, thanks to their larger mass.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Although the solar wind ions are travelling at the same velocity as the electrons, they have a larger mass than the electrons. This gives them a greater momentum, which is created from an object's mass and velocity. Therefore, the solar wind ions are able to transfer more of the necessary momentum to the newly formed atmospheric ions themselves, providing them with more energy to escape.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The electrons themselves probably don't do as much work in driving escape,\" Halekas said. \"They can ionize some atmospheric gases through electron impact ionization, but they won't drive escape through momentum transfer as the ions can.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Because the solar wind's ions play key parts in interacting with other solar wind components, like the electrons and magnetic field, Halekas said SWIA complements several of the other MAVEN instruments.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In order to determine how solar wind ions work with the magnetic fields in the near-Mars environment to aid particle escape, SWIA will work with the MAVEN magnetometer. Together with the solar wind's magnetic field, the ions interact with Mars' upper atmosphere, forming a network of charged particles and magnetic field lines around Mars called a magnetosphere.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"If there were no solar wind ions or magnetic field, the Martian atmosphere would just be a big ball of partially ionized gas sitting in space,\" Halekas said. \"It is the incoming solar wind ions and magnetic field that compress and warp the ionized gas into the teardrop-shaped structure we call a magnetosphere, which any escaping particles must travel through to leave the system.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Unlike Earth, Mars has no global magnetic field. Instead, it has many localized magnetic fields that can disturb the magnetosphere structure. But Halekas said the overall shape was still broadly similar to Earth's magnetosphere.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Since charged particles respond to magnetic forces, the newly charged atmospheric particles can follow paths that depend on the solar wind's magnetic fields. In addition, these magnetic field lines can connect with the planet's own magnetic fields generated in its crust, providing different routes for particles to travel either towards or away from Mars.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Halekas said SWIA was perhaps most complementary to the Suprathermal and Thermal Ion Composition instrument (STATIC), which will measure the planet's ions-including those escaping-while SWIA focuses on the ions from the solar wind. SWIA will also work closely with the Solar Wind Electron Analyzer (SWEA), which will measure the electrons in the solar wind and how they affect particle escape.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Ultimately, all the instruments on MAVEN complement each other,\" Halekas said. \"The payload was very carefully designed to work together.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Although SWIA will be operating continuously throughout the mission, Halekas said its most useful measurements would come from altitudes greater than 190 miles (305 km) above the planet's surface, outside of the main bulk of the atmosphere.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Equipped with a field of view that covers about 70 percent of the sky and is centered on the Sun, SWIA will be able to measure the entire distribution of solar wind ions.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Because SWIA will provide key insight into how solar wind behaves, MAVEN scientist Robert Lillis at SSL said the instrument would be critical in helping understand why Mars doesn't have the dense atmosphere required to maintain life-supporting properties like liquid water on its surface, and whether it ever did.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The history of habitability and atmospheric loss on Mars are linked, and to decipher this history we need to understand how rates of loss of gas from Mars today depend on the properties of solar wind buffeting the upper atmosphere,\" Lillis said. \"SWIA will be one of our sets of eyes aboard MAVEN, constantly monitoring the flow of charged particles from the sun that has helped shape the patterns of atmospheric escape from Mars over billions of years.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Since its development, Halekas said SWIA has undergone many tests and calibrations to ensure it works correctly in space Halekas is responsible for these calibrations, and said there are always unexpected things that will crop up when an instrument is first turned on in space.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"No matter how much testing we perform in advance, and we do a staggering amount, there are inevitably things that we just can't plan for or simulate in a lab,\" Halekas said. \"I anticipate that the first few weeks after SWIA is turned on in flight and the first few weeks after arrival at Mars will therefore be especially exciting and challenging, as we learn how to best operate the instrument in the Martian environment.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Halekas said that no matter what unexpected challenges the SWIA team might face, he is confident that the instrument will perform well, and looks forward to seeing the instrument in action as it helps unlock the Red Planet's mysteries.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Every stage of the mission has been, and will continue to be, a learning experience and a new and exciting challenge,\" Halekas said. \"I'll be ramping up to support the team's scientists in their investigations of all of our observations, with the goal of answering all the big picture questions of MAVEN, and more.\"</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>NASA's Z-2 suit is the newest prototype in its next-generation spacesuit platform, the Z-series. With the agency laser focused on a path to Mars, work to develop the technologies astronauts one day will use to live and work on Mars has already begun. Each iteration of the Z-series will advance new technologies that one day will be used in a suit worn by the first humans to step foot on the Red Planet.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>There are many key advances to be found in the Z-2 suit when compared to the previous Z-1. The most significant is that the Z-1 had a soft upper torso and the Z-2 has a hard composite upper torso. This composite hard upper torso provides the much-needed long-term durability that a planetary Extravehicular Activity (EVA) suit will require. The shoulder and hip joints differ significantly based on extensive evaluations performed during the last two years with the Z-1 to look at different ways of optimizing mobility of these complex joints. Lastly, the boots are much closer in nature to those that would be found on a suit ready for space, and the materials used on the Z-2 are compatible with a full-vacuum environment.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Besides the typical fit checks and mobility evaluations, NASA currently is planning a very comprehensive test campaign for the Z-2 suit. Engineers will conduct multiple vacuum chamber tests, including one series at full vacuum, mimicking the lack of atmosphere found in space. The suit will be tested at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston in the Neutral Buoyancy Lab, the huge indoor pool used to train astronauts to spacewalk. Further testing at a site at Johnson that imitates the rocky Martian surface  will help evaluate the suit's mobility, comfort and performance. Ultimately, all of these tests will guide engineers in designing the Z-3.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>With the Z-2, NASA will employ cover layer design elements, like electroluminescent wiring, never used before in a spacesuit. The designs that were available for voting were produced in collaboration with ILC Dover, the primary suit vendor, and Philadelphia University. The intent of the designs was to highlight certain mobility features for testing. To take it a step further, NASA offered the public the opportunity to decide which of three candidates will be built.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Because the Z-series is still in the prototype, or non-flight, phase, the design won't be making a trip to space. The cover layer of a non-flight suit still performs an important function in ground-based testing. The cover protects the lower layers and technical details from abrasion and snags during testing. It also serves to provide the suit with an aesthetic appeal. The cover layer on flight suits used for spacewalks performs many other important functions like protecting the spacewalker from micrometeorite strikes, the extreme temperatures in space and the harmful effects of radiation. These requirements drive selection of specific high-performance materials and design details that aren't necessary at this stage in a prototype suit.</p>\n",

While the scientists had already proposed this hypothesis -- called \"submarine alkaline hydrothermal emergence of life\" -- the new report assembles decades of field, laboratory and theoretical research into a grand, unified picture. </p>\n",

      "<p>According to the findings, which also can be thought of as the \"water world\" theory, life may have begun inside warm, gentle springs on the sea floor, at a time long ago when Earth's oceans churned across the entire planet. This idea of hydrothermal vents as possible places for life's origins was first proposed in 1980 by other researchers, who found them on the sea floor near Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Called \"black smokers,\" those vents bubble with scalding hot, acidic fluids. In contrast, the vents in the new study -- first hypothesized by scientist Michael Russell of JPL in 1989 -- are gentler, cooler and percolate with alkaline fluids. One such towering complex of these alkaline vents was found serendipitously in the North Atlantic Ocean in 2000, and dubbed the Lost City.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Life takes advantage of unbalanced states on the planet, which may have been the case billions of years ago at the alkaline hydrothermal vents,\" said Russell. \"Life is the process that resolves these disequilibria.\" Russell is lead author of the new study, published in the April issue of the journal Astrobiology.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>Other theories of life's origins describe ponds, or \"soups,\" of chemicals, pockmarking Earth's battered, rocky surface. In some of those chemical soup models, lightning or ultraviolet light is thought to have fueled life in the ponds.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The water world theory from Russell and his team says that the warm, alkaline hydrothermal vents maintained an unbalanced state with respect to the surrounding ancient, acidic ocean -- one that could have provided so-called free energy to drive the emergence of life. In fact, the vents could have created two chemical imbalances. The first was a proton gradient, where protons -- which are hydrogen ions -- were concentrated more on the outside of the vent's chimneys, also called mineral membranes. The proton gradient could have been tapped for energy -- something our own bodies do all the time in cellular structures called mitochondria.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The second imbalance could have involved an electrical gradient between the hydrothermal fluids and the ocean. Billions of years ago, when Earth was young, its oceans were rich with carbon dioxide. When the carbon dioxide from the ocean and fuels from the vent -- hydrogen and methane -- met across the chimney wall, electrons may have been transferred. These reactions could have produced more complex carbon-containing, or organic compounds -- essential ingredients of life as we know it. Like proton gradients, electron transfer processes occur regularly in mitochondria.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Within these vents, we have a geological system that already does one aspect of what life does,\" said Laurie Barge, second author of the study at JPL. \"Life lives off proton gradients and the transfer of electrons.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>As is the case with all advanced life forms, enzymes are the key to making chemical reactions happen. In our ancient oceans, minerals may have acted like enzymes, interacting with chemicals swimming around and driving reactions. In the water world theory, two different types of mineral \"engines\" might have lined the walls of the chimney structures.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"These mineral engines may be compared to what's in modern cars,\" said Russell. \n",
      "<br />\"They make life 'go' like the car engines by consuming fuel and expelling exhaust. DNA and RNA, on the other hand, are more like the car’s computers because they guide processes rather than make them happen.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>One of the tiny engines is thought to have used a mineral known as green rust, allowing it to take advantage of the proton gradient to produce a phosphate-containing molecule that stores energy. The other engine is thought to have depended on a rare metal called molybdenum. This metal also is at work in our bodies, in a variety of enzymes. It assists with the transfer of two electrons at a time rather than the usual one, which is useful in driving certain key chemical reactions. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We call molybdenum the Douglas Adams element,\" said Russell, explaining that the atomic number of molybdenum is 42, which also happens to be the answer to the \"ultimate question of life, the universe and everything\" in Adams' popular book, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\" Russell joked, \"Forty-two may in fact be one answer to the ultimate question of life!\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The team's origins of life theory applies not just to Earth but also to other wet, rocky worlds.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Michael Russell’s theory originated 25 years ago and, in that time, JPL space missions have found strong evidence for liquid water oceans and rocky sea floors on Europa and Enceladus,\" said Barge. \"We have learned much about the history of water on Mars, and soon we may find Earth-like planets around faraway stars. By testing this origin-of-life hypothesis in the lab at JPL, we may explain how life might have arisen on these other places in our solar system or beyond, and also get an idea of how to look for it.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>For now, the ultimate question of whether the alkaline hydrothermal vents are the hatcheries of life remains unanswered. Russell says the necessary experiments are jaw-droppingly difficult to design and carry out, but decades later, these are problems he and his team are still happy to tackle.</p>\n",

It potentially opens the door to other detailed models of objects and terrain on Mars or elsewhere in the solar system.  Researchers expect the technology will also find uses in other applications on Earth, such as life-size 3D reproductions of remote objects or settings. </p>\n",

      "<p>Scientists based the design of the plastic meteorite on detailed measurements and stereo images taken by Opportunity's panoramic camera, or PanCam. The rover took pictures during its 360-degree study of Block Island five years ago. Researcher Kris Capraro works at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.  He says one reason the rock could not be replicated back in 2009 is that the rover could not see every square inch of the meteorite. The missing data created holes in the computer model.  That made the rock data unfit for 3D printing (stereolithography).  The first model Capraro tried to make had lots of holes, so it wouldn't hold together.  It looked like a partially melted plastic pot scrubber.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>The researchers applied software methods usually used to help navigate the rover. They created depth meshes of the meteorite's surface from six positions, then combined them into a three-dimensional digital model, said Capraro.  </p>\n",

      "<p>The 3D printer used for the project is a mainstream tool used in office and light industrial settings. It builds the model from a spool of ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene), a common plastic about the diameter of weed-whacker cord.  To build the contour of the object it is replicating, the printer slowly heats the plastic and layers it precisely. </div></p>\n",

The rock was much bigger than the 3D printer's building space, about the size of the inside of a kitchen oven. To solve that problem, researchers broke up the computer model of the meteorite into 11 sections.  It took 305 hours and 36 minutes to print the parts:  281.11 cubic inches of acrylic thermoplastic media and 37.29 cubic inches of plastic support media that forms the support structure inside the rock model.  Then, researchers were ready to assemble the parts.  Then they finished by painting it to match the real rock's color based on rover images.  For now, said Capraro, \"it's the next best thing to bringing back real Martian rock samples back to Earth.\"\n",

Their task was to begin the process of drawing up a shortlist of the most suitable landing locations for ESA's first Mars rover.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>ExoMars, a joint endeavour between ESA and Russia's Roscosmos space agency, comprises two missions for launch to Mars: the Trace Gas Orbiter and an entry, descent and landing demonstrator module, Schiaparelli, to be launched in 2016; and the ExoMars Rover and Surface Platform scheduled for launch in May 2018, with touchdown on Mars expected in January 2019. The key driver behind the choice of landing site for the 2018 mission is the rover's search for evidence of Martian life, past or present.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A call for landing site proposals was issued last year by ESA and the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, IKI (on behalf of Roscosmos). Eight proposals that were judged to be most appropriate to the mission's requirements were discussed during the recent workshop, and an initial shortlist of four favoured locations was drawn up at the end of the meeting (see below).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>Scientific Criteria</strong></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Present day Mars is a hostile place for living organisms - a frigid desert bathed in high doses of ultraviolet and ionising radiation. However, there is a possibility that primitive life may have gained a foothold when the climate was warmer and wetter, between 3.5 and 4 billion years ago.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Clearly, the ExoMars landing site should be an area of ancient rocks where liquid water was once abundant, preferably in a region that shows signs of sustained or frequently recurring aqueous activity, such as river channels and lakes.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>On Earth, biosignatures can be found in fine-grained sedimentary rocks deposited by slow-moving water, for example, in alluvial plains or river deltas. Some of these rocks, such as clays, are very good at capturing and retaining organic compounds. Clay minerals are also evidence of sustained weathering by ground water of low acidity.</p>\n",

      "</a>\n",
      "</figure>\n",
      "</div>On the other hand, large doses of ionising radiation sterilise the surface and penetrate the Martian subsurface, contributing to the destruction of possible biosignatures. In order to find ancient biomarkers in a good state of preservation, the deposits containing them must have been buried for most of the planet's history and thus protected, until recently, from radiation damage.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p> One further complication is the covering of fine dust which blankets much of Mars. The ExoMars rover will search for molecular biosignatures by drilling into the subsurface, collecting samples and then analysing them in its onboard chemical laboratory. The vehicle can drill to a maximum depth of two metres, so the dust cover at each site should ideally be very thin or non-existent.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Time is of the essence if the maximum scientific return from ExoMars is to be achieved. The rover can cover a limited driving range in the course of its seven-month nominal surface exploration mission. The spacecraft's ballistic entry into the atmosphere is a rather imprecise procedure which means that it could land anywhere within a 104 km x 19 km ellipse. In order to ensure that the rover spends as much time as possible conducting scientific research, a landing ellipse should contain a scattering of suitable sites to ensure that at least some of them are accessible to the rover.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In addition to these scientific requirements, the use of parachutes to slow the spacecraft's descent restricts the landing sites that can be chosen. In particular, candidate sites must all lie at least two kilometres beneath the mean planetary reference level - the Martian equivalent of sea level. This is to ensure that the spacecraft can fly through a sufficiently long atmospheric trajectory for its parachute system to operate properly.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Other important engineering constraints include surface gradients, which if too steep could fool the descent module's radar, the size and distribution of rocks that may topple or damage the lander, and wind speed.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>The Candidate Sites</strong></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The workshop attendees favoured four candidate sites - all of which are located relatively near the equator - that were considered to be the most likely to achieve the mission's objectives. They are: Mawrth Vallis (for which 2, very similar, proposals were received), Oxia Planum, Hypanis Vallis and Oxia Palus.<div class='image_module right' style=''>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>The area around Mawrth Vallis and nearby Oxia Planum contains one of the largest exposures of ancient, clay-rich rocks on the planet. Both regions contain rock types that may have been favourable for complex organic chemistry, and layered rocks that may preserve evidence of past life. Also, some of these deposits seem to have been exhumed within the last few hundred million years, thus reducing their exposure to radiation.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The other two sites represent former fluvial environments. Hypanis Vallis is characterised by fine-grained sedimentary rocks associated with an ancient delta located at the end of a major valley network. Oxia Palus is a region of sedimentary rocks that was buried by impact ejecta and other deposits and has only been exhumed relatively recently.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Over the next few months, members of the ExoMars Landing Site Selection Working Group (LSSWG) will seek to improve their understanding of the scientific and engineering implications associated with each of these four locations, while also devoting some attention to the three remaining sites - Coogoon Valles, Simud Vallis and Southern Isidis.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The LSSWG will then recommend a final shortlist of up to four candidate sites in June 2014, prior to a more detailed analysis.

Its informal name comes from a northwestern Australia region known as the Kimberley. The Martian site's geological appeal, based on images taken from orbit, is that four types of terrain with different rock textures intersect there.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The orbital images didn't tell us what those rocks are, but now that Curiosity is getting closer, we're seeing a preview,\" said Curiosity Deputy Project Scientist Ashwin Vasavada of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"The contrasting textures and durabilities of sandstones in this area are fascinating. While superficially similar, the rocks likely formed and evolved quite differently from each other.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",

The rover found evidence for an ancient lakebed environment favorable for microbial life when it analyzed sample powder drilled from mudstone last year in an area called \"Yellowknife Bay.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>As in the southwestern United States, understanding why some sandstones are harder than others could help explain the major shapes of the landscape where Curiosity is working inside Gale Crater on Mars. Erosion-resistant sandstone forms a capping layer of mesas and buttes. It could even hold hints about why Gale Crater has a large layered mountain, Mount Sharp, at its center. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Erosion-resistant capping layers that Curiosity has sometimes driven across during the rover's traverse since leaving Yellowknife Bay have also presented an engineering challenge for the mission. Some rocks within those layers have sharp points that have punched holes in the rover's aluminum wheels. One of the strategies the rover team has used to reduce the pace of wheel damage is choosing routes that avoid crossing the hard caprock, where feasible.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The wheel damage rate appears to have leveled off, thanks to a combination of route selection and careful driving,\" said JPL's Richard Rainen, mechanical engineering team leader for Curiosity. \"We're optimistic that we're doing OK now, though we know there will be challenging terrain to cross in the future.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The pace at which new holes have appeared in the wheels during recent drives is less than one-tenth what it was a few months ago. Activities with a test rover at JPL this month show that wheels with much more extensive damage than has been sustained by any of Curiosity's six wheels can still perform well. The holes in Curiosity's wheels are all in the thin aluminum skin between much thicker treads. These tests on Earth are using wheels so damaged that many treads are broken, but they still provide traction. </p>\n",

      "</div>A team of scientists at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., has found evidence of past water movement throughout a Martian meteorite, reviving debate in the scientific community over life on Mars.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In 1996, a group of scientists at Johnson led by David McKay, Everett Gibson and Kathie Thomas-Keprta published an article in Science announcing the discovery of biogenic evidence in the Allan Hills 84001(ALH84001) meteorite. In this new study, Gibson and his colleagues focused on structures deep within a 30-pound (13.7-kilogram) Martian meteorite known as Yamato 000593 (Y000593). The team reports that newly discovered different structures and compositional features within the larger Yamato meteorite suggest biological processes might have been at work on Mars hundreds of millions of years ago.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The team's findings have been published in the February issue of the journal Astrobiology. The lead author, Lauren White, is based at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Co-authors are Gibson, Thomas-Keprta, Simon Clemett and McKay, all based at Johnson. McKay, who led the team that studied the ALH84001 meteorite, died a year ago. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"While robotic missions to Mars continue to shed light on the planet's history, the only samples from Mars available for study on Earth are Martian meteorites,\" said White. \"On Earth, we can utilize multiple analytical techniques to take a more in-depth look into meteorites and shed light on the history of Mars. These samples offer clues to the past habitability of this planet. As more Martian meteorites are discovered, continued research focusing on these samples collectively will offer deeper insight into attributes which are indigenous to ancient Mars. Furthermore, as these meteorite studies are compared to present day robotic observations on Mars, the mysteries of the planet's seemingly wetter past will be revealed.\"  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Analyses found that the rock was formed about 1.3 billion years ago from a lava flow on Mars. Around 12 million years ago, an impact occurred on Mars which ejected the meteorite from the surface of Mars. The meteorite traveled through space until it fell in Antarctica about 50,000 years ago.  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The rock was found on the Yamato Glacier in Antarctica by the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition in 2000. The meteorite was classified as a nakhlite, a subgroup of Martian meteorites. Martian meteoritic material is distinguished from other meteorites and materials from Earth and the moon by the composition of the oxygen atoms within the silicate minerals and trapped Martian atmospheric gases.  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The team found two distinctive sets of features associated with Martian-derived clay. They found tunnel and micro-tunnel structures that thread their way throughout Yamato 000593. The observed micro-tunnels display curved, undulating shapes consistent with bio-alteration textures observed in terrestrial basaltic glasses, previously reported by researchers who study interactions of bacteria with basaltic materials on Earth.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The second set of features consists of nanometer- to-micrometer-sized spherules that are sandwiched between layers within the rock and are distinct from carbonate and the underlying silicate layer. Similar spherical features have been previously seen in the Martian meteorite Nakhla that fell in 1911 in Egypt. Composition measurements of the Y000593 spherules show that they are significantly enriched in carbon compared to the nearby surrounding iddingsite layers.  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A striking observation is that these two sets of features in Y000593, recovered from Antarctica after about 50,000 years residence time, are similar to features found in Nakhla, an observed fall collected shortly after landing.  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The authors note that they cannot exclude the possibility that the carbon-rich regions in both sets of features may be the product of abiotic mechanisms: however, textural and compositional similarities to features in terrestrial samples, which have been interpreted as biogenic, imply the intriguing possibility that the Martian features were formed by biotic activity.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The unique features displayed within the Martian meteorite Yamato 000593 are evidence of aqueous alterations as seen in the clay minerals and the presence of carbonaceous matter associated with the clay phases which show that Mars has been a very active body in its past,\" said Gibson. \"The planet is revealing the presence of an active water reservoir that may also have a significant carbon component. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The nature and distribution of Martian carbon is one of the major goals of the Mars Exploration Program. Since we have found indigenous carbon in several Mars meteorites, we cannot overstate the importance of having Martian samples available to study in earth-based laboratories. Furthermore, the small sizes of the carbonaceous features within the Yamato 000593 meteorite present major challenges to any analyses attempted by remote techniques on Mars,\" Gibson added. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"This is no smoking gun,\" said JPL's White. \"We can never eliminate the possibility of contamination in any meteorite. But these features are nonetheless interesting and show that further studies of these meteorites should continue.\" </p>\n",

      "<p>Odyssey was launched in 2001 and began its science mission 12 years ago this month. It is the longest-working spacecraft ever sent to Mars.  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Odyssey completed Tuesday's maneuver at 12:03 p.m. PST (3:03 p.m. EST). It used four thrusters, each providing about 5 pounds (22 newtons) of force for a 29-second burn.</p>\n",

      "<p>Odyssey flies in an orbit nearly over the poles and synchronized with the sun. For most of its first six years at Mars, the orbit was set at about 5 o'clock, local solar time. At every spot Odyssey flew over as it made its dozen daily passes from the north pole region to the south pole region, the local solar time was about 5 p.m. Beneath the south-to-north leg of the orbit, the time was about 5 a.m. That orbit provided an advantage for the orbiter's Gamma Ray Spectrometer to have its cooling equipment pointed away from the sun. The spectrometer checked for evidence of water near the Martian surface. It made important discoveries of how widely water ice -- detected as hydrogen-- and other elements are distributed on Mars. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Later, Odyssey worked for three years in a 4 o'clock orbit. That provided an advantage for mineral mapping by the orbiter's Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS). Mid-afternoon warmth made minerals' infrared signatures easier to identify. This timing, however, added stress to Odyssey's power system. It put more of each orbit into the planet's shadow, where solar panels are unproductive. After providing radio-relay support for the 2012 landing of NASA's Curiosity Mars rover, a maneuver set Odyssey on a slow drift to later times of day to help preserve the spacecraft's aging battery.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>THEMIS Principal Investigator Philip Christensen of Arizona State University in Tempe, proposed letting the time of the orbit shift past 6 o'clock and then making daylight observations on the south-to-north half of the orbit, at about 6:45 a.m., rather than the north-to-south half. The science team and NASA agreed, and the Odyssey project planned this week's maneuver to get to the desired orbit sooner.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We don't know exactly what we're going to find when we get to an orbit where we see the morning just after sunrise,\" Christensen said. \"We can look for seasonal differences.

      "<p>The features are dark, finger-like markings that advance down some Martian slopes when temperatures rise. The new clues include corresponding seasonal changes in iron minerals on the same slopes and a survey of ground temperatures and other traits at active sites. These support a suggestion that brines with an iron-mineral antifreeze, such as ferric sulfate, may flow seasonally, though there are still other possible explanations.</p>\n",

He originally discovered them while an undergraduate at the University of Arizona, Tucson, three years ago, in images from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Ojha and Georgia Tech assistant professor James Wray more recently looked at 13 confirmed RSL sites using images from the same orbiter's Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument. They searched for minerals that RSL might leave in their wake as a way of understanding the nature of these features: water-related or not? </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>They didn't find any spectral signature tied to water or salts. But they did find distinct and consistent spectral signatures of ferric and ferrous minerals at most of the sites. These iron-bearing minerals were more abundant or featured distinct grain sizes in RSL-related materials as compared to non-RSL slopes. These results are in a paper published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Ojha said, \"Just like the RSL themselves, the strength of the spectral signatures varies according to the seasons. They're stronger when it's warmer and less significant when it's colder.\"  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>One possible explanation for these changes is a sorting of grain sizes, such as removal of fine dust from the surface, which could result from either a wet process or dry one. Two other possible explanations are an increase in the more-oxidized (ferric) component of the minerals, or an overall darkening due to moisture. Either of these would point to water, even though no water was directly detected. The spectral observations might miss the presence of water, because the dark flows are much narrower than the area of ground sampled with each CRISM reading. Also, the orbital observations have been made only in afternoons and could miss morning moisture.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The leading hypothesis for these features is the flow of near-surface water, kept liquid by salts depressing the freezing point of pure water. \"The flow of water, even briny water, anywhere on Mars today would be a major discovery, impacting our understanding of present climate change on Mars and possibly indicating potential habitats for life near the surface on modern Mars,\" said Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Project Scientist Richard Zurek, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In related research, reported in a paper to be published by the journal Icarus next month, the Georgia Tech scientists and colleagues at the University of Arizona; U.S. Geological Survey, Flagstaff, Ariz.; and Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, used the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter to look for patterns in where and when the dark seasonal flows exist on Mars. Their results indicate that many sites with slopes, latitudes and temperatures matching known RSL sites do not have any evident RSL. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>They hunted for areas that were ideal locations for RSL formation: areas near the southern mid-latitudes on rocky cliffs. They found 200, but barely any of them had RSL. \"Only 13 of the 200 locations had confirmed RSL,\" said Ojha. \"The fact that RSL occur in a few sites and not others indicates additional unknown factors such as availability of water or salts may play a crucial role in RSL formation.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>They compared new observations with images from previous years, revealing that RSL are much more abundant some years than others. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"NASA likes to 'follow the water' in exploring the Red Planet, so we'd like to know in advance when and where it will appear,\" Wray said. \"RSL have rekindled our hope of accessing modern water, but forecasting wet conditions remains a challenge.\"</p>\n",

      "\r\n",
      "<p>Spacecraft at Mars might get a good look at the nucleus of comet Siding Spring as it heads toward the closest approach, roughly 86,000 miles (138,000 kilometers) from the planet, give or take a few percent. On the other hand, dust particles that the comet nucleus sheds this spring could threaten orbiting spacecraft at Mars in October. </p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The level of risk won't be known for months, but NASA is already evaluating possible precautionary measures as it prepares for studying the comet. </p>\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "<p>Comet Siding Spring, formally named C/2013 A1, was discovered on Jan. 3, 2013, from Australia's Siding Spring Observatory. At the time, it was farther from the sun than Jupiter is. Subsequent observations enabled scientists at JPL and elsewhere to calculate the trajectory the comet will follow as it swings past Mars. Observations in 2014 will continue to refine knowledge of the comet's path, but in approximate terms, Siding Spring's nucleus will come about as close to Mars as one-third of the distance between Earth and the moon.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p><b>Comet Ready for Its Close-up</b></p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Observations of comet Siding Spring are planned using resources on Earth, orbiting Earth, on Mars and orbiting Mars, and some are already underway.  NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and the NEOWISE mission have observed the comet this month both to characterize this first-time visitor from the Oort cloud and to study dust particle sizes and amounts produced by the comet for understanding potential risks to the Mars orbiters. Infrared imaging by NEOWISE reveals a comet that is active and dusty, even though still nearly three-fourths as far from the sun as Jupiter is. Ground-based observatories such as the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility are also expected to join in as the comet becomes favorably positioned for viewing.  </p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>As the comet nears Mars, NASA assets there will be used to study this visitor from distant reaches of the solar system.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>\"We could learn about the nucleus -- its shape, its rotation, whether some areas on its surface are darker than others,\" Zurek said.  </p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Researchers using spacecraft at Mars gained experience at trying to observe a different comet in 2013, as comet ISON (formally C/2012 S1) approached Mars. That comet's Mars-flyby distance was about 80 times farther than Siding Spring's will be. Another difference is that ISON continued inward past Mars for nearly two months, briefly becoming visible to some unaided-eye skywatchers on Earth before flying very close to the sun and disintegrating. Siding Spring will reach its closest approach to the sun just six days after its Mars flyby. It won't put on a show for Earth, and it won't return to the inner solar system for about a million years.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>At comet Siding Spring's flyby distance, the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter could provide imagery with resolution of dozens of pixels across the diameter of the nucleus. When HiRISE observed comet ISON, the nucleus was less than one pixel across. ISON did not get bright enough to make itself visible to other cameras at Mars that made attempted observations, but Siding Spring could provide a better observation opportunity.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Cameras on the Mars rovers Curiosity and Opportunity might watch for meteors in the sky that would be an indication of the abundance of particles in the comet's tail, though the geometry of the flyby would put most of the meteors in daytime sky instead of dark sky.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>\"A third aspect for investigation could be what effect the infalling particles have on the upper atmosphere of Mars,\" Zurek said. \"They might heat it and expand it, not unlike the effect of a global dust storm.\" Infrared-sensing instruments on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Odyssey might be used to watch for that effect.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p><b>Assessing Possible Hazards to Mars Orbiters</b></p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>One trait Siding Spring shares with ISON is unpredictability about how much it will brighten in the months before passing Mars. The degree to which Siding Spring brightens this spring will be an indicator of how much hazard it will present to spacecraft at Mars. </p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>\"It's way too early for us to know how much of a threat Siding Spring will be to our orbiters,\" JPL's Soren Madsen, Mars Exploration Program chief engineer, said last week. \"It could go either way. It could be a huge deal or it could be nothing -- or anything in between.\"</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The path the nucleus will take is now known fairly well. The important unknowns are how much dust will come off the nucleus, when it will come off, and the geometry of the resulting coma and tail of the comet. </p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>During April and May, the comet will cross the range of distances from the sun at which water ice on a comet's surface typically becomes active -- vaporizing and letting dust particles loose. Dust ejected then could get far enough from the nucleus by October to swarm around Mars.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>\"How active will Siding Spring be in April and May? We'll be watching that,\" Madsen said. \"But if the red alarm starts sounding in May, it would be too late to start planning how to respond. That's why we're doing what we're doing right now.\"</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Two key strategies to lessen risk are to get orbiters behind Mars during the minutes of highest risk and to orient orbiters so that the most vulnerable parts are not in the line of fire.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The Martian atmosphere, thin as it is, is dense enough to prevent dust from the comet from becoming a hazard to NASA's two Mars rovers active on the surface. Three orbiters are currently active at Mars:  NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and Mars Odyssey, and the European Space Agency's Mars Express. Two more departed Earth in late 2013 and are due to enter orbit around Mars about three weeks before the comet Siding Spring flyby: NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) and India's Mars Orbiter Mission. </p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Orbiters are designed with the risk of space-dust collisions in mind. Most such collisions do not damage a mission. Design factors such as blanketing and protected placement of vulnerable components help. Over a five-year span for a Mars orbiter, NASA figures on a few percent chance of significant damage to a spacecraft from the background level of impacts from such particles, called meteoroids. Whether the Siding Spring level will pack that much hazard -- or perhaps greater than 10 times more -- into a few hours will depend on how active it becomes.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>This comet is orbiting the sun in almost the opposite direction as Mars and the other planets. The nucleus and the dust particles it sheds will be travelling at about 35 miles (56 kilometers) per second, relative to the Mars orbiters. That's about 50 times faster than a bullet from a high-powered rifle and double or triple the velocity of background meteoroid impacts.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p><b>Cautionary Preparations</b></p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>If managers choose to position orbiters behind Mars during the peak risk, the further in advance any orbit-adjustment maneuvers can be made, the less fuel will be consumed. Advance work is also crucial for the other main option: reorienting a spacecraft to keep its least-vulnerable side facing the oncoming stream of comet particles. The safest orientation in terms of comet dust may be a poor one for maintaining power or communications.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>\"These changes would require a huge amount of testing,\" Madsen said. \"There's a lot of preparation we need to do now, to prepare ourselves in case we learn in May that the flyby will be hazardous.\" </p>\r\n",

In 2016, a Mars lander mission called InSight will launch to take the first look into the deep interior of Mars. The agency also is participating in the European Space Agency's (ESA's) 2016 and 2018 ExoMars missions, including providing \"Electra\" telecommunication radios to ESA's 2016 orbiter and a critical element of the premier astrobiology instrument on the 2018 ExoMars rover. </p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>\"I wasn't particularly interested in space at the time,\" she recalled last week inside the spacecraft operations facility where she now works at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.  \"I remember I was talking with friends, and out of the corner of my eye I noticed this thing bouncing and rolling on a red surface. I watched as it stopped and opened up, and it had this rover inside.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>That animation portrayed how NASA landed the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity three weeks apart, using airbags to cushion the impact at the start of the missions, planned to last for three months. Spirit reached Mars on Jan. 4, 2004, Universal Time (Jan. 3, PST) and worked for six years. Opportunity landed on Jan. 25, UT (Jan. 24, PST) and is still exploring, with Sosland now on the team planning what it does each day.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"I watched that news and said, 'This is amazing: a rover on another planet!' Gears started turning in my head that day about engineering and space -- thinking about a career. It was definitely a milestone in my life and something I'll always remember.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>On her path to that career, high-school teacher Brett Williams in Fredericksburg inspired her to build real rockets, and she completed a 2013 engineering degree from the University of Texas, Austin. But nobody in 2004 was predicting that either Spirit or Opportunity might still be roving Mars in summer 2013, which is when Sosland joined JPL.  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"I certainly never thought I'd have an opportunity to work on Opportunity,\" she said. \"That only became possible because this mission has been going so incredibly long. The reason Opportunity has worked so long is the people who built it and operate it. I'm loving that I can be a part of this team now.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Most of the engineers who operated Spirit and Opportunity during the three-month prime missions in 2004 have switched to other projects, including later Mars spacecraft. Sosland is among several on Opportunity's team today who were in school a decade ago. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Unlike her, Mike Seibert in late 2003 was eagerly tracking the run-up to the rover landings, while he was an engineering undergraduate at the University of Colorado. He had even ordered cardboard 3-D glasses in anticipation of images from stereo cameras on Spirit and Opportunity.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"I was living in my fraternity's house in Boulder that January. People thought I was weird, wearing 3-D glasses and looking at those pictures from Mars,\" said Seibert. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Less than two years later, he was working on the rover team at JPL. He has, since then, served as a mission manager and in other roles for both Spirit and Opportunity and participated in many key moments of the extended missions.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The dramatic landings and overland expeditions of Spirit and Opportunity have also inspired countless students who have not gained a chance to work on the rover team, but have participated in the adventure online by exploring images from the rovers or other activities. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>What an adventure it's been. Though Spirit and Opportunity were built as nearly identical twins, and both succeeded in the main goal of finding evidence for ancient watery environments on Mars, their stories diverged early. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Spirit was sent to a crater where the basin's shape and apparent inflow channels seen from orbit suggested a lake once existed. Opportunity's landing area, almost exactly halfway around the planet, was selected mainly on the basis of a water-clue mineral detected from orbit, rather than landform shapes. Spirit's destination did not pan out initially. The crater may have held a lake, but if there are any lakebed sediments, they are thoroughly buried under later volcanic deposits. Opportunity, the luckier twin, landed a stone's throw from an exposure of layered rock that within weeks yielded compositional and textural evidence of a water-rich ancient environment.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Within the initial three-month missions and without expectation of surviving a full year, each rover set out cross-country toward other destinations: hills on the horizon for Spirit and craters exposing deeper layers for Opportunity. Spirit drove a total of 4.8 miles (7.7 kilometers), some of that with one of its six wheels not rotating. Loss of use of a second wheel while the rover was in a sand trap contributed to the 2010 end of that mission. Opportunity has driven 24 miles (38.7 kilometers) and is still going strong.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>One key to Spirit and Opportunity working for years, instead of a few months, has been winds that occasionally remove some of the dust accumulating on solar panels that generate the rovers' electricity. Also, the ground crew became adept at managing each rover's power consumption and taking advantage of slopes for favorably tilting the rovers toward the sun during Martian winters.</p>\n",

      "<p>By driving to outcrops miles from their landing sites, both rovers reached evidence about multiple episodes of Martian history, \"traveling across time as well as across Martian terrain,\" he said.

      "<p>The rovers' principal investigator, Steve Squyres of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., described some of the key findings, starting with what Spirit found after driving from the crater floor where it landed into hills to the east: </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"In the Columbia Hills, we discovered compelling evidence of an ancient Mars that was a hot, wet, violent place, with volcanic explosions, hydrothermal activity, steam vents -- nothing like Mars today.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"At Opportunity's landing site, we found evidence of an early Mars that had acidic groundwater that sometimes reached the surface and evaporated away, leaving salts behind. It was an environment with liquid water, but very different from the environment that Spirit told us about.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"When Opportunity got to the rim of Endeavour Crater, we began a whole new mission.  We found gypsum veins and a rich concentration of clay minerals. The clay minerals tell us about water chemistry that was neutral, instead of acidic -- more favorable for microbial life, if any ever began on Mars.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Because of the rovers' longevity, we essentially got four different landing sites for the price of two.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The evidence the rovers glean from rocks at these sites may not be the only huge benefit of the adventures, though.  Bekah Sosland and Mike Seibert may be examples of something even greater.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Squyres said, \"I'm incredibly proud of the science we've done on this mission, but in the end, perhaps our most important legacy will turn out to be the young people who have seen what we've done and made career choices based on that. If an outcome of our mission is to help inspire a new generation of explorers to do even better than we did, that will be the greatest thing we could have accomplished.\"</p>\n",

Farley and his co-authors adapted a 60-year-old radiometric method for dating Earth rocks that measures the decay of an isotope of potassium as it slowly changes into argon, an inert gas. Argon escapes when a rock is melted. This dating method measures the amount of argon that accumulates when the rock hardens again.</p>\n",

      "<p>Analyses of three different gases yielded exposure ages in the range of 60 million to 100 million years. This suggests shielding layers above the rock were stripped away relatively recently.

Yellowknife Bay's clay-rich lakebed habitat offers the key chemical elements for life, plus water not too acidic or salty, and an energy source. The energy source is a type used by many rock-eating microbes on Earth: a mix of sulfur- and iron-containing minerals that are ready acceptors of electrons, and others that are ready electron donors, like the two poles of a battery.</p>\n",

Scientists did not notice such leaching.</p>\n",

      "<p>David Vaniman of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz., and co-authors found supporting evidence in a separate mineral analysis of sedimentary rocks at Yellowknife Bay. They noticed a lack of olivine and an abundance of magnetite, which suggests the rocks turned to clay after they washed downstream. The presence of smectite tells about conditions where the clay formed. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Smectite is the typical clay mineral in lake deposits,\" Vaniman said. \"It is commonly called a swelling clay -- the kind that sticks to your boot when you step in it. You find biologically rich environments where you find smectites on Earth.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>John Grotzinger of Caltech and co-authors examined physical characteristics of rock layers in and near Yellowknife Bay and concluded the habitable environment there existed at a time \"relatively young by Martian standards.\" It was a part of Martian history called the Hesperian Era, when parts of the planet were already becoming drier and more acidic, less than 4 billion years ago and roughly the same time as the oldest evidence for life on Earth.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"This habitable environment existed later than many people thought there would be one,\" Grotzinger said. \"This has global implications. It's from a time when there were deltas, alluvial fans and other signs of surface water at many places on Mars, but those were considered too young, or too short-lived, to have formed clay minerals. The thinking was, if they had clay minerals, those must have washed in from older deposits. Now, we know the clay minerals could be produced later, and that gives us many locations that may have had habitable environments, too.\"  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Research suggests habitable conditions in the Yellowknife Bay area may have persisted for millions to tens of millions of years. During that time rivers and lakes probably appeared and disappeared. Even when the surface was dry, the subsurface likely was wet, as indicated by mineral veins deposited by underground water into fractures in the rock. The thickness of observed and inferred tiers of rock layers provides the basis for estimating long duration, and the discovery of a mineral energy source for underground microbes favors habitability throughout. </p>\n",

      "<p>Today's reports include the first measurements of the natural radiation environment on the surface of Mars. Cosmic rays from outside our solar system and energetic particles from the sun bombarded the surface at Gale Crater with an average of 0.67 millisieverts per day from August 2012 to June 2013, according to a report by Don Hassler of Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., and co-authors. For comparison, radiation exposure from a typical chest X-ray is about 0.02 millisievert. That 10-month measurement period did not include any major solar storms affecting Mars, and more than 95 percent of the total came from cosmic rays. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Results from the surface-radiation monitoring provide an additional piece of the puzzle for projecting the total round-trip radiation dose for a future human mission to Mars. Added to dose rates Curiosity measured during its flight to Mars, the Mars surface results project a total round-trip dose rate for a future human mission at the same period in the solar cycle to be on the order of 1,000 millisieverts. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Long-term population studies have shown exposure to radiation increases a person's lifetime cancer risk. Exposure to a dose of 1,000 millisieverts is associated with a 5 percent increase in risk for developing fatal cancer. NASA's current career limit for increased risk for its astronauts currently operating in low-Earth orbit is 3 percent. The agency is working with the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies to address the ethics, principles and guidelines for health standards for long duration and exploration spaceflight missions. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The radiation detected by Curiosity is consistent with earlier predictions. The new data will help NASA scientists and engineers create better models to anticipate the radiation environment human explorers will face, as the agency develops new technologies to protect astronauts in deep space. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Our measurements provide crucial information for human missions to Mars,\" Hassler said. \"We're continuing to monitor the radiation environment and seeing the effects of major solar storms on the surface at different times in the solar cycle, will give additional important data. Our measurements also tie into Curiosity's investigations about habitability. The radiation sources that are concerns for human health also affect microbial survival as well as preservation of organic chemicals.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>If any organic chemicals that are potential signs of life did exist within rocks at about 2 inches (5 centimeters), the depth of Curiosity's drill, Hassler estimated they would be depleted up to 1,000-fold in about 650 million years by radiation at the exposure rate measured in Curiosity's first 10 months. However, the Cumberland rock that Curiosity sampled with its drill at Yellowknife Bay had been exposed to cosmic rays' effects for only about 60 million to 100 million years, by Farley's estimate. Researchers calculate that, with such a young exposure age, enough organic material could still be present in Cumberland to be detectable. Even if Mars has never supported life, the planet receives organic molecules delivered by meteorites, which should leave a detectable trace.</p>\n",

In place for the long Thanksgiving Holiday, Opportunity conducted some in-situ (contact) science at another exposed rock outcrop. On Sol 3502 (Nov. 29, 2013), the rover used the Microscopic Imager (MI) to collect a mosaic of the target named 'Mount Tempest.' That was followed by the placement of the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) on the same for a multi-sol integration. After the holiday pause, the rover began moving again toward the winter destination. </p>\n",

      "<p>On Sol 3505 (Dec. 2, 2013), Opportunity drove over 115 feet (35 meters) towards another energy lily pad that provide a view of the winter destination location. On Sol 3506 (Dec. 3, 2013), the rover pushed another 98 feet (30 meters) south up the grade of Solander Point. However, on that sol higher than expected currents were seen in the right-front wheel. The right-front wheel has exhibited higher than expected currents for years, but had been well behaved recently. So this sudden jump up in current does raise some concerns. Because the rover was in an unfavorable tilt at the end of this drive and the need to get more information about the wheel, a 66 feet (20-meter) drive was sequenced on Sol 3507 (Dec. 5, 2013). This drive included several diagnostic elements. First, we increased the sampling rate on the wheel current to watch it closely. Second, we added a short 3 feet (1-meter) back and forth at the end of the drive. This would provide some insight into the directional behavior of the higher currents. We have been driving backward for years now, so have put more odometry on the rover going backward than forward. The Sol 3507 (Dec. 5 2013), drive show elevated but stable right-front wheel current for the 66-feet (20-meter) backward drive, but reduced current for the short 3-feet (1-meter) forward drive, then elevated again for the 3-feet (1-meter) backward movement. It is too early to say what this means. More investigation, analysis and diagnostics are to be done. </p>\n",

      "<p>The decision to resume science activities resulted from the success of work to diagnose the likely root cause of a Nov. 17 change in voltage on the vehicle. The voltage change itself did not affect the rover safety or health. The vehicle's electrical system has a \"floating bus\" design feature to tolerate a range of voltage differences between the vehicle's chassis -- its mechanical frame -- and the 32-volt power lines that deliver electricity throughout the rover. This protects the rover from electrical shorts.  </p>\n",

      "<p>\"We made a list of potential causes, and then determined which we could cross off the list, one by one,\" said rover electrical engineer Rob Zimmerman of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. Science operations were suspended for six days while this analysis took priority.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The likely cause is an internal short in Curiosity's power source, the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator. Due to resiliency in design, this short does not affect operation of the power source or the rover. Similar generators on other spacecraft, including NASA's Cassini at Saturn, have experienced shorts with no loss of capability. Testing of another Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator over many years found no loss of capability in the presence of these types of internal shorts. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Following the decision to resume science activities, engineers learned early Nov. 23 that the rover had returned to its pre-Nov. 17 voltage level. This reversal is consistent with their diagnosis of an internal short in the generator on Nov. 17, and the voltage could change again.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The analysis work to determine the cause of the voltage change gained an advantage from an automated response by the rover's onboard software when it detected the voltage change on Nov. 17. The rover stepped up the rate at which it recorded electrical variables, to eight times per second from the usual once per minute, and transmitted that engineering data in its next communication with Earth. \"That data was quite helpful,\" Zimmerman said.</p>\n",

      "</figure>\n",
      "</div>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Charles \"Chuck\" Tatro has always been a tinkerer -- an engineer at heart, even as a child. Now he's about to see nearly seven years' worth of engineering effort take off for Mars.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Tatro is the MAVEN mission manager for NASA's Launch Services Program (LSP). MAVEN, which stands for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution, will study Mars' upper atmosphere for clues that may explain the planet's apparent change in climate. When MAVEN rockets away from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V, Tatro will be one of many launch controllers and managers ensuring a smooth start to the mission.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"What a mission manager does in the Launch Services Program is equivalent to a project manager on a major project,\" Tatro said. \"That means making sure the ride -- the rocket -- is procured, verified, and managed correctly. It means making sure we meet the schedule and launch successfully.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Tatro's involvement with MAVEN dates back to the end of 2007. At that time, the mission was merely a proposal, one of several the agency was considering for a future flight. The Launch Services Program reviews all proposals to assess what the launch vehicle needs would be for each. NASA selected MAVEN in September 2008. Since then, Tatro has worked in tandem with the MAVEN project management team from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.; the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder, which leads the mission; and Lockheed Martin Space Systems, which built the spacecraft.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The best part of this mission has been working with a very small project team,\" Tatro said. \"In the past, typically, Mars missions were managed with a cast of hundreds. MAVEN was handled differently, with a small group of technical people and heavy reliance on the Lockheed Martin team.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We've had good esprit de corps. You know people on the spacecraft side, and they know you. We're a team working together for the same goal.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>There are several mission managers within LSP, each assigned to specific projects. A day in the life of an LSP mission manager changes as the years go by and the project progresses from paper to hardware. Early on, it's all about balancing the requirements of the spacecraft with what the launch vehicle providers propose, and ranking and evaluating these from a technical standpoint.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Finally, the flight hardware arrives at the launch site. An Air Force C-17 cargo aircraft delivered MAVEN to Kennedy Space Center on Aug. 2. Its ride to Mars, the Atlas V booster and Centaur upper stage, arrived at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station a few weeks later. At this point -- as preflight milestones are checked off one by one -- the job of the mission manager becomes increasingly demanding.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"You're working the detailed interfaces where spacecraft and launch vehicle connect -- spacecraft to launch vehicle, and launch vehicle to spacecraft. You're managing the technical problems, cost issues, schedule risk, and the team involved,\" he added.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Despite the technical nature of the mission manager role, people-management skills also are critically important, according to Tatro.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"You don't do this alone,\" he said. \"Our team members believe in what they're doing, and if you never ask them to do anything you wouldn't do, you'll always have their support.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>But technical know-how has always been a part of Tatro's life, even as far back as his childhood in Los Alamos, N.M. His father could fix anything; whether the problem was mechanical, electrical or both, his father would figure out what had gone wrong and repair it. Now a resident of Titusville, Fla., Tatro shares these same qualities. Even some of his favorite hobbies, such as bicycling and windsurfing, include elements of engineering: These are technical sports, involving equipment that can break or be made more efficient.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Growing up, I always liked to figure things out,\" Tatro recalled. \"I'd take things apart and put them back together -- and I'd try to improve them. I'd think, 'How can I make this better? How can I get more out of it?'\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>He earned a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering from the University of California, San Diego. He followed up with a master's degree in nuclear engineering from the University of Arizona, this time with emphasis on power systems. Upon graduation, he wrote to NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, and was hired to work on the design and procurement of space station solar arrays.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Tatro came to Kennedy Space Center in 1989 to work on the tiles, reinforced carbon-carbon panels, and specialized blankets that made up the space shuttle orbiters' thermal protection system. A few years later, he switched gears by moving into Kennedy's Environmental Projects Office, which monitors the center's air and water and manages environmental resources.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"You follow where you think the excitement is, and you follow good people,\" Tatro said of the change.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Tatro joined LSP in 1995. Prior to MAVEN, he managed the Pluto-New Horizons launch in 2006 and the 2009 liftoff of Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter/Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite. But don't be fooled by the years between these missions.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Even if it's not your mission, the mission manager is always helping out with Public Affairs, VIPs, and any other outreach,\" Tatro said. \"We're good spokespersons for addressing questions about the launch campaign and can take some of that pressure off the actual mission manager, who at that time is very busy.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>With the MAVEN launch currently scheduled for Nov. 18, Tatro is busy, indeed. Once the mission is underway and the pressure is off, two of the things on his to-do list include spending some extra time with his three high-school-aged sons and playing a lot more tennis.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>But until then, he remains focused on the mission at hand: ensuring a successful launch for MAVEN.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Launch is very exciting,\" he said, \"but there's nothing like the sense of accomplishment and relief when you get confirmation of spacecraft separation -- that it's alive and healthy, on the right trajectory, and on its way to Mars.\"</p>\n",

Today, Mars is a cold and barren desert world, with no sign of life, at least on the surface.

Water under current Martian atmospheric conditions can be ice or sublimate directly into vapor without staying in a liquid phase. Grebowsky is the project scientist for the mission.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The video shows how the surface of Mars might have appeared during this ancient clement period, beginning with a flyover of a Martian lake. The artist's concept is based on evidence that Mars was once very different.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Surface features and mineral compositions suggest ancient Mars had a denser atmosphere and liquid water on its surface, according to Grebowsky. \"There are characteristic dendritic structured channels that, like on Earth, are consistent with surface erosion by water flows. The interiors of some impact craters have basins suggesting crater lakes, with many showing connecting channels consistent with water flows into and out of the crater. Small impact craters have been removed with time and larger craters show signs of erosion by water before 3.7 billion years ago. And sedimentary layering is seen on valley walls. Minerals are present on the surface that can only be produced in the presence of liquid water, e.g., hematite and clays,\" said Grebowsky.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>It's unknown if the habitable climate lasted long enough for life to emerge on Mars. \"The only direct evidence for life early in the history of a planet's evolution is that on Earth,\" said Grebowsky. \"The earliest evidence for terrestrial life is the organic chemical structure of a rock found on the surface in Greenland. The surface was thought to be from an ancient sea floor sediment. The age of the rock was estimated to be 3.8 billion years, 700 million years from the Earth's creation. No fossil evidence of life has yet been found from this period. The oldest claimed micro-fossils (found in Western Australia) date to 3.5 billion years ago. The existence of a potential life-nurturing climate on Mars ended near these times. A comparison between the two planet's life histories must be done with caution, due to the different chemical compositions of the surfaces (e.g., Mars' chemistry may have been more suitable early on than Earth's) and different volcanic and meteoroid impact histories. Also, the histories of life on either planet may not have been continuous. Catastrophic events could have killed off all life at one time only to have it start anew.\"</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>There are several theories of how Mars was stripped of its thick atmosphere. \"Hydrodynamic outflow and ejection from massive asteroid impacts during the later heavy bombardment period (ending 4.1 billion to 3.8 billion years ago) were early processes removing part of the atmosphere, but these were not prominent loss processes afterwards,\" said Grebowsky. \"The leading theory is that Mars lost its intrinsic magnetic field that was protecting the atmosphere from direct erosion by the impact of the solar wind.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The solar wind is a thin stream of electrically charged particles (plasma) blowing continuously from the sun into space at about a million miles per hour. \"The interaction of the atmosphere with the solar wind leads to escape by sputtering of atoms and molecules out of the atmosphere, electromagnetic loss process of the planet's ionospheric particles, direct escape of hot plasma particles or by chemical processes that produce atoms with escape speeds,\" said Grebowsky.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Studies of the remnant magnetic field distributions measured by NASA's Mars Global Surveyor mission set the disappearance of the planet's convection-produced global magnetic field at about 3.7 billion years ago, leaving the Red Planet vulnerable to the solar wind,\" said Grebowsky.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"MAVEN has been designed to measure the escape rates for all the applicable processes and will be able to single out the most prominent,\" said Grebowsky. It will also work with other missions to examine the past habitability of Mars. \"Previous remote Mars observations from orbiting spacecraft have observed the geological features that have been used to estimate the amount of water that did exist and have analyzed the global distribution of water ice and surface chemistry to infer that water was lost through time. Mars Curiosity rover has the ability to analyze the chemical composition of the solid surface, which contains information of the atmospheric composition during the formation of the planet, in particular the isotope ratios, the lower atmosphere composition, and the current gas exchange with surface reservoirs. MAVEN is going to measure the current rates of loss to space and the controlling processes. Given the lower-atmosphere information and the nature of the escaping processes, one can extrapolate from current conditions into the climate of the past,\" said Grebowsky.</p>\n",

      "<p>The video is one of the most complex animations ever produced by NASA's Conceptual Image Lab, located at Goddard. \"We have a lot going on in this,\" said Michael Lentz of Universities Space Research Association, lead animator on the project. \"We have time-lapse clouds happening, the atmosphere and terrain are changing, the water is evaporating away.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Adding to the complexity is the incredibly detailed terrain. Close to three billion polygons - the basic building blocks of computer-generated scenery -- were used, compared to hundreds of thousands for a typical animation, according to Lentz. \"We also used a wide Cinemascope aspect ratio to better showcase the landscape. All this stuff wreaks havoc on the computer system in terms of trying to figure out how to render it.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Rendering is the process by which a computer calculates how to paint a scene, and things like the presence of water increase the complexity of the computations tremendously. The computer has to calculate how the light is hitting the water, how it reflects off the water, how it distorts what's under the water and is refracted by the water. We also used global illumination, a technique to give really realistic outdoor lighting so you don't have intense, sharp black shadows. You have a lot of bounce coming off, so if you have sunlight hitting one side of a canyon, that light then is reflected to the other side, so you're not going to get a black shadow there, you will instead get some of the color off the wall from where the sunlight is reflecting,\" said Lentz.</p>\n",

Liquid water flowed in long rivers that emptied into lakes and shallow seas. A thick atmosphere blanketed the planet and kept it warm. In this cozy environment, living microbes might have found a home, starting Mars down the path toward becoming a second life-filled planet next door to our own.</p>\n",

A thick blanket of CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases would have provided the warmer temperatures and greater atmospheric pressure required to keep liquid water from freezing solid or boiling away.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Something caused Mars to lose that blanket.  One possibility is the solar wind.  Unlike Earth, Mars is not protected by a global magnetic field.  Instead, it has \"magnetic umbrellas\" scattered around the planet that shelter only part of the atmosphere. Erosion of exposed areas by solar wind might have slowly stripped the atmosphere away over billions of years. Recent measurements of isotopes in the Martian atmosphere by Mars rover Curiosity support this idea: light isotopes of hydrogen and argon are depleted compared to their heavier counterparts, suggesting that they have floated away into space.</p>\n",

      "<p>Scientists have also speculated that the planet's surface might have absorbed the CO<sub>2</sub> and locked it up in minerals such as carbonate.

      "<p>MAVEN will be the first mission to Mars specifically designed to help scientists understand the ongoing escape of CO<sub>2</sub> and other gases into space. The probe will orbit Mars for at least one Earth-year. At the elliptical orbit's low point, MAVEN will be 125 km above the surface; its high point will take it more than 6000 km out into space.

      "</div>When the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission launches in November to study why the Red Planet is losing its atmosphere, one of its instruments will look to electrically charged particles called electrons for answers.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Solar Wind Electron Analyzer or SWEA is one of the eight instruments aboard MAVEN that will try to solve the mystery of Mars' dwindling atmosphere, a process that has reduced the planet to a frozen desert.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Produced in a collaboration between the Space Sciences Laboratory (SSL) at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Planétologie (IRAP) in France, SWEA's assignment is to analyze electrons found in two distinct regions around Mars: the solar wind passing by and a layer of Mars' upper atmosphere - the ionosphere.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Instrument lead David L. Mitchell of SSL said that SWEA would use the information on electrons to track how other charged particles, such as planetary oxygen ions, are escaping the planet's atmosphere. Solar wind, which continuously blows off the sun's surface at around a million miles per hour, is packed with charged particles and magnetic field lines that can interact with particles in Mars' upper atmosphere, providing a fraction of them with enough energy to leave the planet.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Using electric fields to bend the paths of electrons onto its detectors, SWEA can differentiate between electrons found in the solar wind and those in the Martian ionosphere by identifying their different energies. Mitchell said solar wind electrons possess a broad range of energies, while those in the planet's atmosphere are produced at specific energies.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The instrument will tell whether the spacecraft is measuring planetary plasma or solar wind plasma,\" Mitchell said, referring to the mixture of electrons and other charged particles. \"It determines the environment, which is important for setting the stage for interpreting other measurements.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>By identifying where solar wind plasma ends and planetary plasma begins, Mitchell said SWEA would be able to zero in on the top of the planet's ionosphere.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We're trying to understand the boundary layer between the solar wind and the planet's ionosphere because this is a key region where planetary material is being lost,\" Mitchell said. \"We want to understand the loss processes and how the solar wind is stripping away the atmosphere.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Mitchell said neutral particles in Mars' atmosphere can become ionized, or electrically charged, by three different mechanisms. In one of these scenarios, neutral molecules absorb solar ultraviolet (UV) light. When its energy is transferred to an electron within the molecule, the electron can be ejected, leaving behind a positively charged ion. This process is known as photoionization. The molecule can also break apart into fragments.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Ionization can also occur when fast moving electrons - either solar wind electrons or newly liberated electrons from the photoionization process - collide with neutral molecules. These collisions can transfer enough energy to eject an electron from the molecule.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Finally, ionization can occur when a fast moving ion from the solar wind crashes into a neutral particle in the atmosphere, stealing one of its electrons in a process known as charge exchange. Gaining an electron causes the solar wind ion to become neutral as it speeds away, leaving the original atmospheric particle ionized in a process Mitchell described as a \"hit and run.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"It takes energy to break apart and ionize atmospheric gases,\" Mitchell said.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Once the atmosphere's neutral atoms or molecules lose an electron and become charged through one of these processes, the magnetic field in the solar wind can pick them up and carry them away as it passes over the planet. To be picked up, the ions first need to reach high altitudes, where they no longer collide with other atmospheric molecules. Mitchell said some ions are produced at a high altitude, while others may be ionized at lower altitudes and gain the energy needed to reach high altitude through different means, like getting accelerated by electric fields.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"One of the goals of MAVEN is to understand how ions get the energy required to reach high altitude,\" Mitchell said.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In addition to energy requirements, Mitchell said the ions must travel along magnetic field lines in order to leave the atmosphere. The electrically charged particles are subject to magnetic forces, causing them to follow magnetic field lines in a corkscrew-like pattern. Working together with the MAVEN Magnetometer, or MAG, SWEA will be able to distinguish electrons traveling in one direction along the magnetic field from those traveling in the opposite direction. By measuring the energies of electrons traveling in each direction, SWEA can determine whether a magnetic field line passes through the ionosphere, connects with the solar wind, or forms a closed loop. Over the course of many orbits around the planet, SWEA and MAG can create a \"road map\" of how charged particles move in the Martian environment.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>While Earth actively generates a global magnetic field within its core, Mars' magnetic field is dominated by magnetized rock in its crust. Unlike the north and south magnetic poles of Earth, Mitchell said Mars features many localized magnetic fields, as if there were many bar magnets scattered all over the planet. This complex configuration of magnetic fields rotates with the planet once every 24.6 hours - a full Martian day - which makes studying the routes for charged particle escape as challenging as it is interesting.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In addition, the solar wind has its own embedded magnetic field that wraps around the planet's ionosphere.  The interactions between the two fields can provide different mechanisms for particles to exit.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"These two systems of magnetic fields can connect with one another,\" Mitchell said. \"There will be times when crustal magnetic field will open up and connect with solar wind's magnetic field lines, forming a path for solar wind plasma to travel down into the atmosphere or a path for planetary ions and electrons to travel upwards and escape.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Mitchell said the SWEA measurements would complement several other instruments aboard, including the magnetometer, to determine whether the interacting magnetic field lines are forming possible escape routes.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"This is one reason why the SWEA and MAG instruments are important,\" Mitchell said. \"They tell us whether the magnetic field opens into the solar wind, providing a conduit for escape, or whether it forms closed loops and traps the ionosphere.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>SWEA also complements the Langmuir probe, which will measure electrons that are moving too slowly for SWEA to detect.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The entire package is going to be working together,\" Mitchell said.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>SWEA will make measurements over a wide range of altitudes ranging from 93 miles (150 km) to 3,870 miles (6,230 km) above the planet's surface. The instrument will also make extremely fast measurements - around every two seconds - at low altitudes where rapid changes in magnetic configurations are expected.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The instrument will have to overcome a distinct challenge in order to make its measurements - the spacecraft itself. Although the instrument can observe an impressive 86 percent of the sky, the spacecraft will block some of the instrument's vision. Furthermore, the spacecraft itself can become charged and bend the trajectories of electrons as they pass nearby, increasing the fraction of the sky blocked by the spacecraft. To reduce this effect, Mitchell said SWEA will be positioned on the end of one of the spacecraft's booms, keeping it far enough away to minimize the effects of the spacecraft .</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In addition to making a major scientific contribution to the MAVEN mission, SWEA lead electronics engineer Ellen Taylor of SSL said the instrument marked an important collaboration between IRAP in France - which produced the instrument's analyzer - and the SSL, which produced the instrument's electronics.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The international collaboration is significant, and making sure you have input from all over is very useful,\" Taylor said. \"It's always beneficial to both sides, as the science itself is the main importance and the engineering is a nice collaboration, since we're getting hardware from [IRAP] that we can fly on our spacecraft.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Although the instrument was a lot of work to develop, Mitchell said the results it's capable of producing make it worthwhile.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"It's been a tremendous amount of work,\" Mitchell said. \"But it's all coming together, and it feels good to have the instrument on the spacecraft, and we're looking forward to launching it on its way to Mars.\"</p>\n",

      "<br />\"Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has shown that Mars is still an active planet, with changes such as new craters, avalanches and dust storms,\" Zurek said. \"Mars is a partially frozen world, but not frozen in time.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Each of the 200 trillion bits of science data from the orbiter has followed a complex path, aided by sophisticated software to make it feasible for a small team to handle tens of billions of new bits daily and get the data products to the appropriate scientists.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Data gathered by the orbiter's instruments and relayed from rovers are recorded onto the orbiter's central memory. Each orbit around Mars takes the spacecraft about two hours. For part of each orbit, Mars itself usually blocks the communication path to Earth. When Earth is in view, a Deep Space Network antenna on whichever part of Earth is turned toward Mars at that hour can be listening. Complex preparations coordinate scheduling the use of the network's antennas by all deep-space missions -- 32 of them this month. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter typically gets several sessions every day.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The Deep Space Network collects the incoming data into 30-minute chunks,\" said Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter software engineer Bryan Allen, of JPL. \"At that point, it doesn't matter which products are in it -- just a big pile of bits.\"  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The chunks of mixed data from the antenna stations in California, Spain and Australia come to JPL, where software sorts it into specific products, such as an image from a camera, measurements from a scan of the atmosphere, radar readings from the subsurface sounder, or data from a rover. Another process at JPL determines which products to send where -- such as to a mineral-mapping team in Maryland, a camera team in Arizona, a radar team in Italy. On a typical recent day, the system sorted 58 billion bits from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter into 303 data products.</p>\n",

      "<p>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter mission met all its science goals in a two-year primary science phase ending in 2008. Three extensions, the latest beginning in 2012, have added to the science returns. The longevity of this mission and of NASA's even longer-lived Mars Odyssey orbiter, which has been studying Mars since 2002, have given researchers tools to study seasonal and longer-term changes on the Red Planet.</p>\n",

This is exactly the kind of event NASA's MAVEN mission is designed to observe. But MAVEN is sitting this one out in a hangar in Florida. The Mars-bound mission doesn't launch until November.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"I am so disappointed!\" said Bruce Jakosky, MAVEN principal investigator at the University of Colorado Boulder. MAVEN hasn't missed its only chance, he added. These events happen frequently, more so in the sun's current solar activity phase, which goes through an approximately 11-year cycle. Once in orbit around Mars, MAVEN will be positioned to observe multiple future mass ejections and measure how they erode Mars' atmosphere over time.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>But Jakosky still wishes MAVEN could have seen this Halloween flurry. \"It's like standing in line to get into a football game when you hear the crowd cheer for a touchdown.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, are a natural part of the solar atmosphere's variability. Magnetic fields emerge through the sun's surface, generated by internal currents of gas known as the solar dynamo. These fields control the structure of the corona, the sun's atmosphere, which can be seen as a bright halo surrounding the sun during a solar eclipse. A major disturbance in these fields may release a hot, fast plasma bubble as the corona adjusts itself - a CME. Spacecraft such as the joint European Space Agency and NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory observe CMEs moving like compression waves - such as those preceding a fast speedboat plowing across a lake - trailed by a chaotic cloud of coronal plasma ejecta.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"It's more than a heavy-duty gust of solar wind,\" said Janet Luhmann, MAVEN's deputy principal investigator at the University of California Berkeley. \"It's an actual piece of the corona.\" The coronal plasma is comprised of charged hydrogen gas, broken down into protons and electrons. When these plasma particles rocket out of the sun as a CME, they can travel at speeds of 600 miles per second (1,000 km/s) or even faster, compared to a speed of about 250 miles per second (400 km/s) for the normal solar wind.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>But a CME can impel other particles to travel even faster. The leading compression wave, traveling through the solar wind, can steepen into an interplanetary shock wave. That shock can accelerate solar wind particles to up to one-third the speed of light.  These particles are called, appropriately, solar energetic particles and can be hazardous to both equipment and humans in space.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>During periods of peak solar activity, the sun can fire off as many as three CMEs a day. MAVEN's active mission will come at a point in the 11-year solar activity cycle where solar activity is waning, yet solar storms are still frequent. CMEs aimed at Mars present the best scientific opportunities for MAVEN, but the spacecraft may still be able to detect effects of other events, including plasma, energetic particles and magnetic fields, Luhmann said.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Any spacecraft in the path of a CME - as MAVEN hopes to be - will first see a surge of solar energetic particles, which rush ahead of the leading shock wave. The particles may arrive at Mars as soon as 20 minutes after the event.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Once the shock wave arrives (within two or three days) the spacecraft will detect a sudden increase in magnetic field strength and in the density of solar wind particles, which are piled up by the compression wave like snow before a plow. Solar activity can interfere with spacecraft electronic systems and instruments, but it's unlikely that MAVEN will suffer permanent damage from the radiative onslaught.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We've planned for that,\" Luhmann said. \"Many other planetary spacecraft have survived space weather like this.\" At worst, she said, a particularly strong storm may tax the spacecraft's sensors. MAVEN is designed to continue science operations even during the strongest storms.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The atmosphere of Mars, on the other hand, may not emerge unscathed. MAVEN's mission at Mars, in part, is to observe how solar particles affect, and may deplete, Mars' atmosphere. Solar radiation normally produces an electrical charge in gas atoms, creating ions in a high-altitude layer of the atmosphere called the ionosphere. Some of these atmospheric ions, such as oxygen and carbon ions, are picked up by the magnetic fields in the passing solar wind and can be carried away into space. Some may also be carried back into the atmosphere where they can shed their energy, heating the atoms around them. This heating could also lead to atmospheric escape. CMEs enhance the energy of these ions, and may accelerate atmospheric loss.\n",

      "<p>MAVEN's scientific team will study how CMEs affect the rate of atmospheric loss at Mars, compared with the loss due to the solar wind. Everyday atmospheric loss, occurring one molecule at a time, can be compared to sand-grain-by-sand-grain coastal erosion on Earth, said Jared Espley, space scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. \"One way of looking at coastal erosion is to see how much erodes every time the tide comes in,\" he said. \"Or, you could also look to see how much erosion occurs every time a tsunami comes through.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>Recent Mars missions discovered conclusive evidence that water flowed over the surface of Mars billions of years ago. \"Something catastrophic happened to change it into the place it is today,\" Espley said. MAVEN hopes to explore the role atmospheric loss to space played in that catastrophic climate change.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Luhmann isn't concerned that MAVEN missed this solar event. On the contrary, she said, the Halloween CMEs reassure the team that MAVEN will likely see some solar fireworks. \"We'd like to see how Mars responds to large space weather events, and so this actually is not bad at all,\" she said. \"This is good.\"</p>\n",

The autonomous-driving portion began where that left off, with Curiosity evaluating the best way to reach designated waypoints ahead. The vehicle drove about 125 feet (38 meters) autonomously on Sunday. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We needed to store some key variables in the rover's non-volatile memory for the next day,\" said JPL rover driver John Wright. Curiosity's volatile memory is cleared when the rover goes into energy-conserving sleep mode overnight. </p>\n",

      "<p>\"This is our first real Martian mountaineering with Opportunity,\" said the principal investigator for the rover, Steve Squyres of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y.  \"We expect we will reach some of the oldest rocks we have seen with this rover -- a glimpse back into the ancient past of Mars.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The hill rises southward as a ridge from Solander Point, forming an elevated portion of the western rim of Endeavour Crater. The crater spans 14 miles (22 kilometers) in diameter.  The ridge materials were uplifted by the great impact that excavated the crater billions of years ago, reversing the common geological pattern of older materials lying lower than younger ones. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Key targets on the ridge include clay-bearing rocks identified from observations by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars, which is on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The observations were specially designed to yield mineral maps with enhanced spatial resolution.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This segment of the crater's rim stands much higher than \"Cape York,\" a segment to the north that Opportunity investigated for 20 months beginning in mid-2011.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"At Cape York, we found fantastic things,\" Squyres said. \"Gypsum veins, clay-rich terrain, the spherules we call newberries. We know there are even larger exposures of clay-rich materials where we're headed. They might look like what we found at Cape York or they might be completely different.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Opportunity reached Solander Point in August after months of driving from Cape York. Researchers then used the rover to investigate a transition zone around the base of the ridge. The area reveals contact between a sulfate-rich geological formation and an older formation. The sulfate-rich rocks record an ancient environment that was wet, but very acidic. The contact with older rocks may tell researchers about a time when environmental conditions changed.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Opportunity first explored the eastern side of Solander Point, then drove back north and around the point to explore the western side. \"We took the time to find the best place to start the ascent,\" said Opportunity's project manager, John Callas of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.  \"Now we've begun that climb.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The rover began the climb on Oct. 8 and has advanced farther uphill with three subsequent drives.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We're in the right place at the right time, on a north-facing slope,\" Callas said. In Mars' southern hemisphere, a north-facing slope tilts the rover's solar panels toward the sun during the Martian winter, providing an important boost in available power. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>During the most recent of the five winters that Opportunity has worked on Mars, the rover spent several months without driving, safe on a small, north-facing patch of northern Cape York. The area where the rover is now climbing, however, offers a much larger north-facing area, with plenty of energy-safe ground for the rover to remain mobile. Opportunity is currently at a northward tilt of about 17 degrees. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In the coming Martian winter, daily sunshine will reach a minimum in February 2014. The rover team plans a \"lily pad\" strategy to make use of patches of ground with especially favorable slopes as places to recharge the rover's batteries between drives.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Opportunity landed on Mars on Jan. 25, 2004 (Universal Time and EST; Jan. 24, PST), three weeks after its twin, Spirit. Spirit was the first Martian mountaineer, summiting a 269-foot (82-meter) hill in 2005. Spirit ceased operations in 2010.  NASA's newest Mars rover, Curiosity, landed in 2012 and is currently driving toward a 3-mile-high (5-kilometer-high) mountain. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Recent drives by Opportunity and Curiosity have taken the total distance driven by NASA's four Mars rovers (including Sojourner in 1997) past 50 kilometers. The total on Oct. 21 was 31.13 miles (50.10 kilometers), including 23.89 miles (38.45 kilometers) by Opportunity. </p>\n",

      "</div>PASADENA, Calif. -- Examination of the Martian atmosphere by NASA's Curiosity Mars rover confirms that some meteorites that have dropped to Earth really are from the Red Planet. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A key new measurement of the inert gas argon in Mars' atmosphere by Curiosity's laboratory provides the most definitive evidence yet of the origin of Mars meteorites while at the same time providing a way to rule out Martian origin of other meteorites.  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The new measurement is a high-precision count of two forms of argon -- argon-36 and argon-38 -- accomplished by the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument inside the rover. These lighter and heavier forms, or isotopes, of argon exist naturally throughout the solar system. On Mars the ratio of light to heavy argon is skewed because much of that planet's original atmosphere was lost to space. The lighter form of argon was taken away more readily because it rises to the top of the atmosphere more easily and requires less energy to escape. That left the Martian atmosphere relatively enriched in the heavier isotope, argon-38. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Years of past analyses by Earth-bound scientists of gas bubbles trapped inside Martian meteorites had already narrowed the Martian argon ratio to between 3.6 and 4.5 (that is 3.6 to 4.5 atoms of argon-36 to every one of argon-38). Measurements by NASA's Viking landers in the 1970s put the Martian atmospheric ratio in the range of four to seven. The new SAM direct measurement on Mars now pins down the correct argon ratio at 4.2. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We really nailed it,\" said Sushil Atreya of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, lead author of an Oct. 16 paper reporting the finding in Geophysical Research Letters. \"This direct reading from Mars settles the case with all Martian meteorites.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>One reason scientists have been so interested in the argon ratio in Martian meteorites is that it was -- before Curiosity -- the best measure of how much atmosphere Mars has lost since the planet's wetter, warmer days billions of years ago. Figuring out the planet's atmospheric loss would enable scientists to better understand how Mars transformed from a once water-rich planet, more like our own, into today's drier, colder and less-hospitable world. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Had Mars held onto all of its atmosphere and its original argon, its ratio of the gas would be the same as that of the sun and Jupiter. Those bodies have so much gravity that isotopes can't preferentially escape, so their argon ratio -- which is 5.5 -- represents that of the primordial solar system. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>While argon makes up only a tiny fraction of the gas lost to space from Mars, it is special because it's a noble gas. That means the gas is inert, not reacting with other elements or compounds, and therefore a more straightforward tracer of the history of the Martian atmosphere. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Other isotopes measured by SAM on Curiosity also support the loss of atmosphere, but none so directly as argon,\" said Atreya. \"Argon is the clearest signature of atmospheric loss because it's chemically inert and does not interact or exchange with the Martian surface or the interior. This was a key measurement that we wanted to carry out on SAM.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Curiosity measurements do not directly measure the current rate of atmospheric escape, but NASA's next mission to Mars, the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission (MAVEN), is designed to do so. That mission is being prepared at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida for a launch-opportunity period that begins on Nov. 18.</p>\n",

      "<p>HiRISE saw a small spot at the position of ISON that is relatively bright, like a star, but moving relative to actual stars.

      "<p>Based on preliminary analysis of the data, the comet appears to be at the low end of the range of brightness predictions for the observation. As a result, the image isn't visually pleasing but low coma activity is best for constraining the size of the nucleus. This image has a scale of approximately 8 miles (13.3 km) per pixel, larger than the comet, but the size of the nucleus can be estimated based on the typical brightness of other comet nuclei. The comet, like Mars, is currently 241 million kilometers from the Sun. As the comet gets closer to the sun, its brightness will increase to Earth-based observers and the comet may also become intrinsically brighter as the stronger sunlight volatilizes the comet's ices. </p>\n",

The comet will pass within 724,000 miles (1.16 million kilometers) of the Sun on 28 November 2013.

      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />Examination of loose rocks, sand and dust has provided new understanding of the local and global processes on Mars. Analysis of observations and measurements by the rover's science instruments during the first four months after the August 2012 landing are detailed in five reports in the Sept. 27 edition of the journal Science. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A key finding is that water molecules are bound to fine-grained soil particles, accounting for about 2 percent of the particles' weight at Gale Crater where Curiosity landed. This result has global implications, because these materials are likely distributed around the Red Planet.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity also has completed the first comprehensive mineralogical analysis on another planet using a standard laboratory method for identifying minerals on Earth. The findings about both crystalline and non-crystalline components in soil provide clues to the planet's volcanic history.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Information about the evolution of the Martian crust and deeper regions within the planet comes from Curiosity's mineralogical analysis of a football-size igneous rock called \"Jake M.\" Igneous rocks form by cooling molten material that originated well beneath the crust. The chemical compositions of the rocks can be used to infer the thermal, pressure and chemical conditions under which they crystallized. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"No other Martian rock is so similar to terrestrial igneous rocks,\" said Edward Stolper of the California Institute of Technology, lead author of a report about this analysis. \"This is surprising because previously studied igneous rocks from Mars differ substantially from terrestrial rocks and from Jake M.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The other four reports include analysis of the composition and formation process of a windblown drift of sand and dust, by David Blake of NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif., and co-authors. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity examined this drift, called Rocknest, with five instruments, preforming an onboard laboratory analysis of samples scooped up from the Martian surface. The drift has a complex history and includes sand particles with local origins, as well as finer particles that sample windblown Martian dust distributed regionally or even globally.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The rover is equipped with a laser instrument to determine material compositions from some distance away. This instrument found that the fine-particle component in the Rocknest drift matches the composition of windblown dust and contains water molecules. The rover tested 139 soil targets at Rocknest and elsewhere during the mission's first three months and detected hydrogen -- which scientists interpret as water -- every time the laser hit fine-particle material.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The fine-grain component of the soil has a similar composition to the dust distributed all around Mars, and now we know more about its hydration and composition than ever before,\" said Pierre-Yves Meslin of the Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Planétologie in Toulouse, France, lead author of a report about the laser instrument results.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A laboratory inside Curiosity used X-rays to determine the composition of Rocknest samples. This technique, discovered in 1912, is a laboratory standard for mineral identification on Earth. The equipment was miniaturized to fit on the spacecraft that carried Curiosity to Mars, and this has yielded spinoff benefits for similar portable devices used on Earth. David Bish of Indiana University in Bloomington co-authored a report about how this technique was used and its results at Rocknest.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>X-ray analysis not only identified 10 distinct minerals, but also found an unexpectedly large portion of the Rocknest composition is amorphous ingredients, rather than crystalline minerals. Amorphous materials, similar to glassy substances, are a component of some volcanic deposits on Earth. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Another laboratory instrument identified chemicals and isotopes in gases released by heating the Rocknest soil in a tiny oven. Isotopes are variants of the same element with different atomic weights. These tests found water makes up about 2 percent of the soil, and the water molecules are bound to the amorphous materials in the soil.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The ratio of hydrogen isotopes in water released from baked samples of Rocknest soil indicates the water molecules attached to soil particles come from interaction with the modern atmosphere,\" said Laurie Leshin of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., lead author of a report about analysis with the baking instrument. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Baking and analyzing the Rocknest sample also revealed a compound with chlorine and oxygen, likely chlorate or perchlorate, which previously was known to exist on Mars only at one high-latitude site. This finding at Curiosity's equatorial site suggests more global distribution.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>\"We examined pebbly sandstone deposited by water flowing over the surface, and veins or fractures in the rock,\" said Dawn Sumner of University of California, Davis, a Curiosity science team member with a leadership role in planning the stop. \"We know the veins are younger than the sandstone because they cut through it, but they appear to be filled with grains like the sandstone.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This Waypoint 1 site at an outcrop called \"Darwin\" is the first of up to five waypoint stops planned along the route of about 5.3 miles (8.6 kilometers) between the \"Glenelg\" area, where Curiosity worked for the first half of 2013, and an entry point to the lower slope of Mount Sharp, the mission's main destination. It is about one-fifth of the way along the route. The rover departed Waypoint 1 on Sept. 22 with a westward drive of about 75 feet (22.8 meters).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity's science team planned the waypoints to collect information about the geology between Glenelg and Mount Sharp. Researchers want to understand relationships between what the mission already discovered at Glenelg and what it may find in the multiple layers of Mount Sharp. Analysis of drilled samples from veined \"Yellowknife Bay\" rocks in the Glenelg area provided evidence for a past lakebed environment with conditions favorable for microbial life. That means the mission has fulfilled its principal science goal.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />\"We want to understand the history of water in Gale Crater,\" Sumner said. \"Did the water flow that deposited the pebbly sandstone at Waypoint 1 occur at about the same time as the water flow at Yellowknife Bay? If the same fluid flow produced the veins here and the veins at Yellowknife Bay, you would expect the veins to have the same composition. We see that the veins are different, so we know the history is complicated. We use these observations to piece together the long-term history.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Researchers set the top priority for the Waypoint 1 stop to be examination of a conglomerate rock outcrop, such as the pebbly sandstone. The veins were a bonus.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"As often happens, the closer we get, the more is revealed,\" said Kenneth Williford of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., a Curiosity science team member active in planning use of the rover's arm. The first specific location at Waypoint 1 for parking the rover and using the instruments on its arm was selected because images taken from nearly a football-field's length away showed outcrops that looked like conglomerate. Once Curiosity approached that location, new images showed the veins, so a second location for use of the arm was added to the plan.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The rover spent one day using its arm at the first location and three more using its arm from the second location. On all four of these \"contact-science\" days, the investigations employed two instruments that are mounted in the turret at the end of the arm: the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer, which identifies chemical elements present in a target, and the Mars Hand Lens Imager, which shows targets' textures, shapes and colors. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Another device on the turret still holds some powder from a rock that Curiosity drilled into for sample collection at Yellowknife Bay four months ago. The laboratory instruments inside the rover have already analyzed portions from this sample, but researchers have options of many different instrument settings for doing further analyses. In weeks ahead, additional portions from the sieved powder being held in the arm may be delivered for those analyses. The powder is a precious scientific resource, but it also presents a special challenge for use of the spectrometer and camera on the turret. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We don't want to put the turret in a position that gets the sample material onto the back side of the sieve, because that could clog pores in the sieve,\" said JPL's Matt Robinson, lead engineer for Curiosity's robotic arm operations.  \"We have to consider the orientation of the turret during all of the moves for reaching the target, not just its orientation at the target.\"</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>Working from their consoles at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, a team of test engineers from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, better known as JPL, conducted more than a week of evaluations on the antennas and circuitry aboard the spacecraft.</p>\n",

      "<p>The testing was standard stuff for the engineers, but nonetheless mind-bending considering that the spacecraft will operate millions of miles from Earth and rely on commands from operators at Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>To mimic the distances between the spacecraft and Earth, the electronic signals sent between the two during testing are run through a cabling system that quickly ramps down the power by going through various wiring networks.</p>\n",

      "<p>\"We'll try to squeeze the signal down to its lowest possible point,\" said Chris Green, an engineer with Exelis who supervised the testing. \"It's a machine and we test its actual flight performance -- every scenario of flight configuration it would be in is what we go through in testing.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We allow the project to get online and do what they would do on a normal day so they can perform all the tasks through us just as if MAVEN was actually in space,\" said Lorenzo Morgan, one of the engineers operating and evaluating the procedures.</p>\n",

      "<p>Although every spacecraft goes through intense communications testing, the work is not considered routine because every spacecraft has unique requirements.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Every mission is different, every mission has its own peculiarities,\" said Albert Ibarra, also a test engineer for the communications system. \"You have to know the details on every spacecraft design and so you become familiar with it as soon as they start putting the spacecraft together.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>NASA has an intricate system of antennas in California, Spain and Australia to pick up and transmit signals to its fleet of spacecraft that now reaches out beyond the solar system in the form of Voyager 1.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Called the Deep Space Network and referred to by its acronym, DSN, the system uses antennas almost as big as a football field to communicate with the spacecraft that are using their own much smaller antennas and more limited power sources.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>It's the system NASA uses to communicate with all of its interplanetary probes and some of the spacecraft studying Earth, as well. In addition to Voyager 1, whose signal is incredibly weak because of the vast distance it is from Earth, the network is picking up signals from newer spacecraft such as New Horizons, which is speeding toward Pluto. Cassini in orbit around Saturn, Juno on its way to Jupiter and the Curiosity rover operating on Mars all relay their data to Earth on the DSN and get their commands from ground operators through the same network.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Kennedy's portion of the DSN structure is a testing facility called MIL-71, a reference to the time when the space center was known as the Merritt Island Launch Annex. Every time a spacecraft comes to Kennedy for launch preparations, a team of engineers sets up racks of equipment and computer servers before beginning several days of 12-hour shifts to make sure the mission's communications system and interface with the Deep Space Network will work.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>With the spacecraft checked out, the team takes its gear back to California and gets ready for launch day, knowing very well that it won't hear anything from the spacecraft until well after liftoff.

      "</div>PASADENA, Calif. -- Data from NASA's Curiosity rover has revealed the Martian environment lacks methane. This is a surprise to researchers because previous data reported by U.S. and international scientists indicated positive detections.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />The roving laboratory performed extensive tests to search for traces of Martian methane. Whether the Martian atmosphere contains traces of the gas has been a question of high interest for years because methane could be a potential sign of life, although it also can be produced without biology.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"This important result will help direct our efforts to examine the possibility of life on Mars,\" said Michael Meyer, NASA's lead scientist for Mars exploration. \"It reduces the probability of current methane-producing Martian microbes, but this addresses only one type of microbial metabolism. As we know, there are many types of terrestrial microbes that don't generate methane.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity analyzed samples of the Martian atmosphere for methane six times from October 2012 through June and detected none. Given the sensitivity of the instrument used, the Tunable Laser Spectrometer, and not detecting the gas, scientists calculate the amount of methane in the Martian atmosphere today must be no more than 1.3 parts per billion. That is about one-sixth as much as some earlier estimates. Details of the findings appear in the Thursday edition of Science Express.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"It would have been exciting to find methane, but we have high confidence in our measurements, and the progress in expanding knowledge is what's really important,\" said the report's lead author, Chris Webster of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"We measured repeatedly from Martian spring to late summer, but with no detection of methane.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Webster is the lead scientist for spectrometer, which is part of Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) laboratory. It can be tuned specifically for detection of trace methane. The laboratory also can concentrate any methane to increase the gas' ability to be detected. The rover team will use this method to check for methane at concentrations well below 1 part per billion.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Methane, the most abundant hydrocarbon in our solar system, has one carbon atom bound to four hydrogen atoms in each molecule. Previous reports of localized methane concentrations up to 45 parts per billion on Mars, which sparked interest in the possibility of a biological source on Mars, were based on observations from Earth and from orbit around Mars. However, the measurements from Curiosity are not consistent with such concentrations, even if the methane had dispersed globally.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"There's no known way for methane to disappear quickly from the atmosphere,\" said one of the paper's co-authors, Sushil Atreya of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. \"Methane is persistent. It would last for hundreds of years in the Martian atmosphere. Without a way to take it out of the atmosphere quicker, our measurements indicate there cannot be much methane being put into the atmosphere by any mechanism, whether biology, geology, or by ultraviolet degradation of organics delivered by the fall of meteorites or interplanetary dust particles.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The highest concentration of methane that could be present without being detected by Curiosity's measurements so far would amount to no more than 10 to 20 tons per year of methane entering the Martian atmosphere, Atreya estimated. That is about 50 million times less than the rate of methane entering Earth's atmosphere. </p>\n",

      "<p>\"To make sure we have a smooth transition, regaining attitude knowledge as quickly as possible, we will power off all instruments, do the IMU swap, maneuver to sun point, do the IMU swap, and then put the spacecraft into safe mode,\" Thomas said. \"The safe-mode process re-initializes the spacecraft's knowledge of its attitude.\"</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>\"Scientists believe the planet has evolved significantly over the past 4.5 billion years,\" said David Mitchell, MAVEN's project manager for NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center in Maryland. \"It had a thicker atmosphere and water flowing on the surface. It wasn't like Earth, but it was not like it is today.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Before any of those studies can take place at Mars, though, the spacecraft will see a few months of intense launch processing at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The MAVEN spacecraft, short for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution, stands inside the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility at Kennedy where engineers and technicians are taking the first steps in getting it ready for launch in November.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The instruments, systems and all-important power-generating solar array wings on the 5,400-pound spacecraft (once fueled) will be tested repeatedly inside the clean room at the Kennedy facility. Engineers also will fuel the spacecraft so it can maneuver through space and arrive safely in orbit around Mars.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>MAVEN arrived at Kennedy Aug. 2 on a C-17 transport aircraft.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"A big part of our schedule was getting to the Cape on time,\" Mitchell said. \"We have marked this as a big milestone we had to hit because if you miss this launch period, you stand down for 26 months until the planets are aligned again.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Technicians spent the first week reinstalling equipment that was removed for the flight such as the high-gain antenna the spacecraft uses to transmit data to Earth.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The spacecraft will be powered on during its second week at Kennedy and tests will begin in earnest soon afterward, Mitchell said.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When the testing and fueling is complete, a payload fairing will be placed around MAVEN and it will be trucked to Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. MAVEN will be hoisted atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V for launch Nov. 18 to begin a 10-month cruise to Mars.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Testing the MAVEN calls for stringent guidelines since the spacecraft will face the stresses of spaceflight throughout its mission. For example, the two solar arrays will have to withstand differing pressures of flying from the vacuum of space to even the tenuous layers of the Martian upper atmosphere during each orbit.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>MAVEN carries instruments that can take samples of the Martian atmosphere directly when it flies as low as 77 miles above the surface, plus devices that will analyze the planet from more than 3,700 miles away.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"MAVEN is going after something the others haven't,\" Mitchell said. \"It's going to look at the current composition of the upper atmosphere and how solar storms and other factors changed the atmosphere.  We'll then be able to project back in time to see how it was in an earlier epoch.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The MAVEN flight comes on the heels of remarkable successes by NASA's Mars exploration efforts, including the landing a year ago of the rover Curiosity that has conducted detailed geological studies on the Martian surface.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"MAVEN will help us understand the climate history, which is the history of habitability.\"  said Bruce Jakosky, planetary scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder and MAVEN's principal investigator,  \"Although MAVEN is not going to detect life, it's trying to understand the environment that might have been able to support life.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Mars has long intrigued NASA and planetary researchers for a host of reasons including the fact that its surface does not look unlike some places on Earth, although its atmosphere would be far from hospitable to humans. Since NASA landed two Viking probes on the planet in 1976 and followed up with a series of orbiters, landers and rovers from 1996 to last year, Earthbound observes have been flabbergasted by numerous discoveries including the potential for abundant liquid water.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"There's something about going to another planet that's very exciting,\" Mitchell said. \"When you're talking about going to Mars, it isn't hard to get great people to come work the job. And ultimately, the mysteries that MAVEN will help decipher should be a treasure trove for the science community.</p>\n",

      "</div>PASADENA, Calif. - NASA's Mars rover Curiosity drove twice as far on July 21 as on any other day of the mission so far: 109.7 yards (100.3 meters).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The length of the drive took advantage of starting the 340th Martian day, or sol, of the mission from a location with an unusually good view for rover engineers to plan a safe path. In weeks to come, the rover team plans to begin using \"autonav\" capability for the rover to autonomously navigate a path for itself, which could make such long drives more frequent. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity is about three weeks into a multi-month trek, from the \"Glenelg\" area where it worked for the first half of 2013, to an entry point for the mission's major destination: the lower layers of Mount Sharp. The mission's longest one-day drive prior to July 21 was about 54 yards (49 meters), on Sol 50 (Sept. 26, 2012). After completing the longer drive, Curiosity drove 68.2 yards (62.4 meters) on July 23 (Sol 342), bringing the mission's total driving distance so far to 0.81 mile (1.23 kilometers).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Sol 340 drive included three segments, with turns at the end of the first and second segments. Rover planners used information from stereo imaging by the Navigation Camera (Navcam) on Curiosity's mast, plus images from the telephoto-lens Mast Camera (Mastcam).  The drive also used the rover's capability to use imagery taken during the drive to calculate the driving distance, a way to verify that wheels have not been slipping too much while turning.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"What enabled us to drive so far on Sol 340 was starting at a high point and also having Mastcam images giving us the size of rocks so we could be sure they were not hazards,\" said rover planner Paolo Bellutta of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"We could see for quite a distance, but there was an area straight ahead that was not clearly visible, so we had to find a path around that area.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The rover was facing southwest when the sol began. It turned slightly more to the west before driving and used visual odometry to be sure it drove the intended distance (about 55 yards or 50 meters) before turning back farther southward. The second leg, next turn, and third leg completed the drive without visual odometry, though the rover was using another new capability: to turn on visual odometry autonomously if tilt or other factors exceed predetermined limits.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>New software on Curiosity gives it the capability to use visual odometry through a range of temperatures. This was needed because testing this spring indicated the Navcam pair linked to the rover's B-side computer is more sensitive to temperature than anticipated. Without the compensating software, the onboard analysis of stereo images could indicate different distances to the same point, depending on the temperature at which the images are taken. The rover was switched from its A-side computer to the redundant B-side computer on Feb. 28 due to a flash-memory problem -- subsequently resolved -- on the A-side. The Navcam pair linked to the A-side computer shows less variability with temperature than the pair now in use.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"For now, we're using visual odometry mostly for slip-checking,\" said JPL's Jennifer Trosper, deputy project manager for Curiosity. \"We are validating the capability to begin using autonav at different temperatures.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The autonomous navigation capability will enable rover planners to command drives that go beyond the route that they can confirm as safe from previous-sol images. They can tell the rover to use the autonomous capability to choose a safe path for itself beyond that distance.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity landed at the \"Bradbury Landing\" location within Gale Crater on Aug. 6, 2012, EDT and Universal Time (Aug. 5, PDT). From there, the rover drove eastward to the Glenelg area, where it accomplished the mission's major science objective of finding evidence for an ancient wet environment that had conditions favorable for microbial life. The rover's route is now southwestward. At Mount Sharp, in the middle of Gale Crater, scientists anticipate finding evidence about how the ancient Martian environment changed and evolved.</p>\n",

      "</div>PASADENA, Calif. - A pair of new papers report measurements of the Martian atmosphere's composition by NASA's Curiosity rover, providing evidence about loss of much of Mars' original atmosphere.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) suite of laboratory instruments inside the rover has measured the abundances of different gases and different isotopes in several samples of Martian atmosphere. Isotopes are variants of the same chemical element with different atomic weights due to having different numbers of neutrons, such as the most common carbon isotope, carbon-12, and a heavier stable isotope, carbon-13.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>SAM checked ratios of heavier to lighter isotopes of carbon and oxygen in the carbon dioxide that makes up most of the planet's atmosphere. Heavy isotopes of carbon and oxygen are both enriched in today's thin Martian atmosphere compared with the proportions in the raw material that formed Mars, as deduced from proportions in the sun and other parts of the solar system. This provides not only supportive evidence for the loss of much of the planet's original atmosphere, but also a clue to how the loss occurred.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"As atmosphere was lost, the signature of the process was embedded in the isotopic ratio,\" said Paul Mahaffy of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.  He is the principal investigator for SAM and lead author of one of the two papers about Curiosity results in the July 19 issue of the journal Science.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Other factors also suggest Mars once had a much thicker atmosphere, such as evidence of persistent presence of liquid water on the planet's surface long ago even though the atmosphere is too scant for liquid water to persist on the surface now. The enrichment of heavier isotopes measured in the dominant carbon-dioxide gas points to a process of loss from the top of the atmosphere -- favoring loss of lighter isotopes -- rather than a process of the lower atmosphere interacting with the ground.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity measured the same pattern in isotopes of hydrogen, as well as carbon and oxygen, consistent with a loss of a substantial fraction of Mars' original atmosphere. Enrichment in heavier isotopes in the Martian atmosphere has previously been measured on Mars and in gas bubbles inside meteorites from Mars. Meteorite measurements indicate much of the atmospheric loss may have occurred during the first billion years of the planet's 4.6-billion-year history. The Curiosity measurements reported this week provide more precise measurements to compare with meteorite studies and with models of atmospheric loss. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Curiosity measurements do not directly measure the current rate of atmospheric escape, but NASA's next mission to Mars, the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission (MAVEN), will do so. \"The current pace of the loss is exactly what the MAVEN mission now scheduled to launch in November of this year is designed to determine,\" Mahaffy said.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The new reports describe analysis of Martian atmosphere samples with two different SAM instruments during the initial 16 weeks of the rover's mission on Mars, which is now in its 50th week. SAM's mass spectrometer and tunable laser spectrometer independently measured virtually identical ratios of carbon-13 to carbon-12. SAM also includes a gas chromatograph and uses all three instruments to analyze rocks and soil, as well as atmosphere.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Getting the same result with two very different techniques increased our confidence that there's no unknown systematic error underlying the measurements,\" said Chris Webster of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. He is the lead scientist for the tunable laser spectrometer and the lead author for one of the two papers. \"The accuracy in these new measurements improves the basis for understanding the atmosphere's history.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity landed inside Mars' Gale Crater on Aug. 6, 2012 Universal Time (on Aug. 5 PDT). The rover this month began a drive of many months from an area where it found evidence for a past environment favorable for microbial life, toward a layered mound, Mount Sharp, where researchers will seek evidence about how the environment changed.   </p>\n",

      "<p>Designed and developed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., the state-of-the-art instrument will launch aboard MAVEN, short for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution, in November.

      "<p>\"The data could be used to build models showing how Mars has lost the majority of its atmosphere, a phenomenon that continues to be one of the planet's greatest mysteries,\" said Paul Mahaffy, the spectrometer's principal investigator from Goddard.</p>\n",

      "<p>Each specific voltage isolates ions based on their specific mass. This allows the instrument to build a profile, known as a mass spectrum, of all the different gas particles present in the Martian atmosphere.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We're basically sorting ions by mass,\" Mahaffy said.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Besides measuring the ions already present in the atmosphere, the instrument could also create ions from neutral gas molecules. An electron gun will fire a beam of electrons, breaking the gas molecules into smaller, charged particles. By doing this, the instrument can collect information on all of the gas particles, both neutral and charged, in the upper atmosphere.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Our part of the overall mission is to measure the neutral and ion composition of the atmosphere,\" Mahaffy said. \"We're measuring ions that are already there and those that are created.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The instrument will measure the composition of the current atmosphere and how variables like time of day change the gas particles over time. This critical information can then be used to build simulations of both the current Martian atmosphere and the atmosphere billions of years ago.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"What we're doing is measuring the composition of the atmosphere as a measure of latitude, longitude, time of day and solar activities,\" Mahaffy said. \"We're trying to understand over billions of years how the atmosphere has been lost.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>While it's unknown why Mars has lost most of its atmosphere, scientists point to solar wind for stripping it. The planet itself lacks a global magnetic field, which typically protects planets like Earth from solar wind, maintaining the atmosphere. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>If the models can accurately portray the Martian atmosphere billions of years ago, scientists might be able to answer critical questions like whether the atmosphere was once substantial enough to sustain liquid water on its surface and support life. Currently, the planet is barren and below freezing, with much of its water seen near the surface as ice.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The big question is can the models help us understand the atmosphere back in time,\" Mahaffy said. \"This is another part of the puzzle in understanding what [the] atmosphere is like that's intended to be solved by the MAVEN mission.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The spectrometer instrument, known by the acronym \"NGIMS,\" will be located on a platform below the spacecraft, keeping it away from its own gases and allowing it to face different directions. It will collect data when MAVEN is between about 93 and 311 miles (150 and 500 kilometers) above the planet, storing it in the spacecraft's memory bank for several days before it's transmitted to NASA's Deep Space Network satellites around the globe. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In addition to providing important information on its own, NGIMS would complement other instruments aboard, specifically the Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrometer, which would also measure gas composition.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Both instruments get composition of the atmosphere and how it changes based on variables,\" Mahaffy said. \"Not only do the different instruments get different species, but we measure at different locations, and that's really helpful for understanding what the atmosphere is doing.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>NGIMS electrical lead Florence Tan said the information the instrument is trying to find supports mankind's desire to determine if Earth is the only planet supporting life.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>The instrument promises to collect a lot of exciting data.</p>\n",
      "\n",

      "<p>\"Scientists have long hypothesized that the northern lowlands of Mars are a dried-up ocean bottom, but no one yet has found the smoking gun,\" says Mike Lamb, an assistant professor of geology at Caltech and a coauthor of the paper describing the results. The paper was published online in the July 12 issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Although the new findings are far from proof of the existence of an ancient ocean, they provide some of the strongest support yet, says Roman DiBiase, a postdoctoral scholar at Caltech and lead author of the paper.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Most of the northern hemisphere of Mars is flat and at a lower elevation than the southern hemisphere, and thus appears similar to the ocean basins found on Earth. The border between the lowlands and the highlands would have been the coastline for the hypothetical ocean.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Caltech team used new high-resolution images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) to study a 100-square-kilometer area that sits right on this possible former coastline. Previous satellite images have shown that this area-part of a larger region called Aeolis Dorsa, which is about 1,000 kilometers away from Gale Crater where the Curiosity rover is now roaming-is covered in ridge-like features called inverted channels.</p>\n",

This remaining sediment appears as today's ridge-like features, tracing the former river system.</p>\n",

      "</div>To figure out which of these scenarios was most likely, the researchers turned to satellite images taken by the HiRISE camera on MRO. By taking pictures from different points in its orbit, the spacecraft was able to make stereo images that have allowed scientists to determine the topography of the martian surface. The HiRISE camera can pick out features as tiny as 25 centimeters long on the surface and the topographic data can distinguish changes in elevation at a resolution of 1 meter.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Using this data, the Caltech researchers analyzed the stratigraphic layers of the inverted channels, piecing together the history of how sediments were deposited along these ancient rivers and streams. The team was able to determine the slopes of the channels back when water was still coursing through them. Such slope measurements can reveal the direction of water flow-in this case, showing that the water was spreading out instead of converging, meaning the channels were part of an alluvial fan or a delta.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>But the researchers also found evidence for an abrupt increase in slope of the sedimentary beds near the downstream end of the channels. That sort of steep slope is most common when a stream empties into a large body of water-suggesting that the channels are part of a delta and not an alluvial fan.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Scientists have discovered martian deltas before, but most are inside a geological boundary, like a crater. Water therefore would have most likely flowed into a lake enclosed by such a boundary and so did not provide evidence for an ocean.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>But the newly discovered delta is not inside a crater or other confining boundary, suggesting that the water likely emptied into a large body of water like an ocean. \"This is probably one of the most convincing pieces of evidence of a delta in an unconfined region-and a delta points to the existence of a large body of water in the northern hemisphere of Mars,\" DiBiase says. This large body of water could be the ocean that has been hypothesized to have covered a third of the planet. At the very least, the researchers say, the water would have covered the entire Aerolis Dorsa region, which spans about 100,000 square kilometers.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Of course, there are still other possible explanations. It is plausible, for instance, that at one time there was a confining boundary-such as a large crater-that was later erased, Lamb adds. But that would require a rather substantial geological process and would mean that the martian surface was more geologically active than has been previously thought.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The next step, the researchers say, is to continue exploring the boundary between the southern highlands and northern lowlands-the hypothetical ocean coastline-and analyze other sedimentary deposits to see if they yield more evidence for an ocean. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"In our work and that of others-including the Curiosity rover-scientists are finding a rich sedimentary record on Mars that is revealing its past environments, which include rain, flowing water, rivers, deltas, and potentially oceans,\" Lamb says. \"Both the ancient environments on Mars and the planet's sedimentary archive of these environments are turning out to be surprisingly Earth-like.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The title of the Journal of Geophysical Research paper is \"Deltaic deposits at Aeolis Dorsa: Sedimentary evidence for a standing body of water on the northern plains of Mars.\" In addition to DiBiase and Lamb, the other authors of the paper are graduate students Ajay Limaye and Joel Scheingross, and Woodward Fischer, assistant professor of geobiology.

      "\n",
      "<p>The 154-page document was prepared by the Mars 2020 Science Definition Team, which NASA appointed in January to outline scientific objectives for the mission. The team, composed of 19 scientists and engineers from universities and research organizations, proposed a mission concept that could accomplish several high-priority planetary science goals and be a major step in meeting President Obama's challenge to send humans to Mars in the 2030s. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Crafting the science and exploration goals is a crucial milestone in preparing for our next major Mars mission,\" said John Grunsfeld, NASA's associate administrator for science in Washington. \"The objectives determined by NASA with the input from this team will become the basis later this year for soliciting proposals to provide instruments to be part of the science payload on this exciting step in Mars exploration.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>NASA will conduct an open competition for the payload and science instruments. They will be placed on a rover similar to Curiosity, which landed on Mars almost a year ago. Using Curiosity's design will help minimize mission costs and risks and deliver a rover that can accomplish the mission objectives. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The 2020 mission proposed by the Science Definition Team would build upon the accomplishments of Curiosity and other Mars missions.  The Spirit and Opportunity rovers, along with several orbiters, found evidence Mars has a watery history. Curiosity recently confirmed that past environmental conditions on Mars could have supported living microbes. According to the Science Definition Team, looking for signs of past life is the next logical step.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The team's report details how the rover would use its instruments for visual, mineralogical and chemical analysis down to microscopic scale to understand the environment around its landing site and identify biosignatures, or features in the rocks and soil that could have been formed biologically.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The Mars 2020 mission concept does not presume that life ever existed on Mars,\" said Jack Mustard, chairman of the Science Definition Team and a professor at the Geological Sciences at Brown University in Providence, R.I. \"However, given the recent Curiosity findings, past Martian life seems possible, and we should begin the difficult endeavor of seeking the signs of life. No matter what we learn, we would make significant progress in understanding the circumstances of early life existing on Earth and the possibilities of extraterrestrial life.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The measurements needed to explore a site on Mars to interpret ancient habitability and the potential for preserved biosignatures are identical to those needed to select and cache samples for future return to Earth. The Science Definition Team is proposing the rover collect and package as many as 31 samples of rock cores and soil for a later mission to bring back for more definitive analysis in laboratories on Earth. The science conducted by the rover's instruments would expand our knowledge of Mars and provide the context needed to make wise decisions about whether to return the samples to Earth.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The Mars 2020 mission will provide a unique capability to address the major questions of habitability and life in the solar system,\" said Jim Green, director of NASA's Planetary Science Division in Washington. \"This mission represents a major step towards creating high-value sampling and interrogation methods, as part of a broader strategy for sample returns by planetary missions.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Samples collected and analyzed by the rover will help inform future human exploration missions to Mars. The rover could make measurements and technology demonstrations to help designers of a human expedition understand any hazards posed by Martian dust and demonstrate how to collect carbon dioxide, which could be a resource for making oxygen and rocket fuel. Improved precision landing technology that enhances the scientific value of robotic missions also will be critical for eventual human exploration on the surface.</p>\n",

      "<p>The new set of Mars Climate Sounder observations sampled a range of times of day and night all over Mars. The observations found that the pattern is dominant globally and year-round. The report is being published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Global oscillations of wind, temperature and pressure repeating each day or fraction of a day are called atmospheric tides. In contrast to ocean tides, they are driven by variation in heating between day and night. Earth has atmospheric tides, too, but the ones on Earth produce little temperature difference in the lower atmosphere away from the ground. On Mars, which has only about one percent as much atmosphere as Earth, they dominate short-term temperature variations throughout the atmosphere.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Tides that go up and down once per day are called \"diurnal.\" The twice-a-day ones are called \"semi-diurnal.\" The semi-diurnal pattern on Mars was first seen in the 1970s, but until now it had been thought to appear just in dusty seasons, related to sunlight warming dust in the atmosphere. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We were surprised to find this strong twice-a-day structure in the temperatures of the non-dusty Mars atmosphere,\" Kleinboehl said. \"While the diurnal tide as a dominant temperature response to the day-night cycle of solar heating on Mars has been known for decades, the discovery of a persistent semi-diurnal response even outside of major dust storms was quite unexpected, and caused us to wonder what drove this response.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>He and his four co-authors found the answer in the water-ice clouds of Mars. The Martian atmosphere has water-ice clouds for most of the year. Clouds in the equatorial region between about 6 to 19 miles (10 to 30 kilometers) above the surface of Mars absorb infrared light emitted from the surface during daytime. These are relatively transparent clouds, like thin cirrus clouds on Earth. Still, the absorption by these clouds is enough to heat the middle atmosphere each day. The observed semi-diurnal temperature pattern, with its maximum temperature swings occurring away from the tropics, was also unexpected, but has been replicated in Mars climate models when the radiative effects of water-ice clouds are included.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We think of Mars as a cold and dry world with little water, but there is actually more water vapor in the Martian atmosphere than in the upper layers of Earth's atmosphere,\" Kleinboehl said. \"Water-ice clouds have been known to form in regions of cold temperatures, but the feedback of these clouds on the Mars temperature structure had not been appreciated. We know now that we will have to consider the cloud structure if we want to understand the Martian atmosphere. This is comparable to scientific studies concerning Earth's atmosphere, where we have to better understand clouds to estimate their influence on climate.\"</p>\n",

      "<p></div>PASADENA, Calif. -- NASA research indicates hunks of frozen carbon dioxide -- dry ice -- may glide down some Martian sand dunes on cushions of gas similar to miniature hovercraft, plowing furrows as they go. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Researchers deduced this process could explain one enigmatic class of gullies seen on Martian sand dunes by examining images from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and performing experiments on sand dunes in Utah and California. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"I have always dreamed of going to Mars,\" said Serina Diniega, a planetary scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and lead author of a report published online by the journal Icarus. \"Now I dream of snowboarding down a Martian sand dune on a block of dry ice.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The hillside grooves on Mars, called linear gullies, show relatively constant width -- up to a few yards, or meters, across -- with raised banks or levees along the sides. Unlike gullies caused by water flows on Earth and possibly on Mars, they do not have aprons of debris at the downhill end of the gully. Instead, many have pits at the downhill end. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"In debris flows, you have water carrying sediment downhill, and the material eroded from the top is carried to the bottom and deposited as a fan-shaped apron,\" said Diniega. \"In the linear gullies, you're not transporting material. You're carving out a groove, pushing material to the sides.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Images from MRO's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera show sand dunes with linear gullies covered by carbon-dioxide frost during the Martian winter. The location of the linear gullies is on dunes that spend the Martian winter covered by carbon-dioxide frost. By comparing before-and-after images from different seasons, researchers determined that the grooves are formed during early spring. Some images have even caught bright objects in the gullies.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Scientists theorize the bright objects are pieces of dry ice that have broken away from points higher on the slope. According to the new hypothesis, the pits could result from the blocks of dry ice completely sublimating away into carbon-dioxide gas after they have stopped traveling.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Linear gullies don't look like gullies on Earth or other gullies on Mars, and this process wouldn't happen on Earth,\" said Diniega. \"You don't get blocks of dry ice on Earth unless you go buy them.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>That is exactly what report co-author Candice Hansen, of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz., did. Hansen has studied other effects of seasonal carbon-dioxide ice on Mars, such as spider-shaped features that result from explosive release of carbon-dioxide gas trapped beneath a sheet of dry ice as the underside of the sheet thaws in spring. She suspected a role for dry ice in forming linear gullies, so she bought some slabs of dry ice at a supermarket and slid them down sand dunes. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>That day and in several later experiments, gaseous carbon dioxide from the thawing ice maintained a lubricating layer under the slab and also pushed sand aside into small levees as the slabs glided down even low-angle slopes.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The outdoor tests did not simulate Martian temperature and pressure, but calculations indicate the dry ice would act similarly in early Martian spring where the linear gullies form. Although water ice, too, can sublimate directly to gas under some Martian conditions, it would stay frozen at the temperatures at which these gullies form, the researchers calculate.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"MRO is showing that Mars is a very active planet,\" Hansen said. \"Some of the processes we see on Mars are like processes on Earth, but this one is in the category of uniquely Martian.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Hansen also noted the process could be unique to the linear gullies described on Martian sand dunes. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"There are a variety of different types of features on Mars that sometimes get lumped together as 'gullies,' but they are formed by different processes,\" she said. \"Just because this dry-ice hypothesis looks like a good explanation for one type doesn't mean it applies to others.\"</p>\n",

      "</div>PASADENA, Calif. - Approaching its 10th anniversary of leaving Earth, NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity is on the move again, trekking to a new study area still many weeks away.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The destination, called \"Solander Point,\" offers Opportunity access to a much taller stack of geological layering than the area where the rover has worked for the past 20 months, called \"Cape York.\" Both areas are raised segments of the western rim of Endeavour Crater, which is about 14 miles (22 kilometers) in diameter.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Getting to Solander Point will be like walking up to a road cut where you see a cross section of the rock layers,\" said Ray Arvidson of Washington University, St. Louis, deputy principal investigator for the mission. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Solander Point also offers plenty of ground that is tilted toward the north, which is favorable for the solar-powered rover to stay active and mobile through the coming Martian southern-hemisphere winter. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We're heading to a 15-degree north-facing slope with a goal of getting there well before winter,\" said John Callas of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., project manager for the Mars Exploration Rover Project. The minimum-sunshine days of this sixth Martian winter for Opportunity will come in February 2014.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Project launched twin rovers in 2003:  Spirit on June 10 and Opportunity on July 7. Both rovers landed in January 2004, completed three-month prime missions and began years of bonus, extended missions. Both found evidence of wet environments on ancient Mars. Spirit ceased operations during its fourth Martian winter, in 2010. Opportunity shows symptoms of aging, such as loss of motion in some joints, but continues to accomplish groundbreaking exploration and science.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Shortly before leaving Cape York last month, Opportunity used the rock abrasion tool, the alpha particle X-ray spectrometer and the microscopic imager on its robotic arm to examine a rock called \"Esperance\" and found a combination of elements pointing to clay-mineral composition. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The Esperance results are some of the most important findings of our entire mission,\" said Steve Squyres of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., principal investigator for the mission. \"The composition tells us about the environmental conditions that altered the minerals. A lot of water moved through this rock.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Cape York exposes just a few yards, or meters, of vertical cross-section through geological layering. Solander Point exposes roughly 10 times as much. Researchers hope to find evidence about different stages in the history of ancient Martian environments. The rim of Endeavour Crater displays older rocks than what Opportunity examined at Eagle, Endurance, Victoria and Santa Maria craters during the first eight years of the rover's work on Mars.</p>\n",

      "</div>PASADENA, Calif. - NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission is approaching its biggest turning point since landing its rover, Curiosity, inside Mars' Gale Crater last summer. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity is finishing investigations in an area smaller than a football field where it has been working for six months, and it will soon shift to a distance-driving mode headed for an area about 5 miles (8 kilometers) away, at the base of Mount Sharp.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In May, the mission drilled a second rock target for sample material and delivered portions of that rock powder into laboratory instruments in one week, about one-fourth as much time as needed at the first drilled rock. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We're hitting full stride,\" said Mars Science Laboratory Project Manager Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"We needed a more deliberate pace for all the first-time activities by Curiosity since landing, but we won't have many more of those.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>No additional rock drilling or soil scooping is planned in the \"Glenelg\" area that Curiosity entered last fall as the mission's first destination after landing. To reach Glenelg, the rover drove east about a third of a mile (500 meters) from the landing site. To reach the next destination, Mount Sharp, Curiosity will drive toward the southwest for many months.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We don't know when we'll get to Mount Sharp,\" Erickson said. \"This truly is a mission of exploration, so just because our end goal is Mount Sharp doesn't mean we're not going to investigate interesting features along the way.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Images of Mount Sharp taken from orbit and images Curiosity has taken from a distance reveal many layers where scientists anticipate finding evidence about how the ancient Martian environment changed and evolved.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>While completing major first-time activities since landing, the mission has also already accomplished its main science objective. Analysis of rock powder from the first drilled rock target, \"John Klein,\" provided evidence that an ancient environment in Gale Crater had favorable conditions for microbial life: the essential elemental ingredients, energy and ponded water that was neither too acidic nor too briny.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The rover team chose a similar rock, \"Cumberland,\" as the second drilling target to provide a check for the findings at John Klein. Scientists are analyzing laboratory-instrument results from portions of the Cumberland sample. One new capability being used is to drive away while still holding rock powder in Curiosity's sample-handling device to supply additional material to instruments later if desired by the science team.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>For the drill campaign at Cumberland, steps that each took a day or more at John Klein could be combined into a single day's sequence of commands. \"We used the experience and lessons from our first drilling campaign, as well as new cached sample capabilities, to do the second drill campaign far more efficiently,\" said sampling activity lead Joe Melko of JPL. \"In addition, we increased use of the rover's autonomous self-protection. This allowed more activities to be strung together before the ground team had to check in on the rover.\"\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />The science team has chosen three targets for brief observations before Curiosity leaves the Glenelg area: the boundary between bedrock areas of mudstone and sandstone, a layered outcrop called \"Shaler\" and a pitted outcrop called \"Point Lake.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>JPL's Joy Crisp, deputy project scientist for Curiosity, said \"Shaler might be a river deposit. Point Lake might be volcanic or sedimentary. A closer look at them could give us better understanding of how the rocks we sampled with the drill fit into the history of how the environment changed.\" </p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity's Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) is the first instrument to measure the radiation environment during a Mars cruise mission from inside a spacecraft that is similar to potential human exploration spacecraft. The findings reduce uncertainty about the effectiveness of radiation shielding and provide vital information to space mission designers who will need to build in protection for spacecraft occupants in the future.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"As this nation strives to reach an asteroid and Mars in our lifetimes, we're working to solve every puzzle nature poses to keep astronauts safe so they can explore the unknown and return home,\" said William Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for human exploration and operations in Washington. \"We learn more about the human body's ability to adapt to space every day aboard the International Space Station. As we build the Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System rocket to carry and shelter us in deep space, we'll continue to make the advances we need in life sciences to reduce risks for our explorers. Curiosity's RAD instrument is giving us critical data we need so that we humans, like the rover, can dare mighty things to reach the Red Planet.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The findings, which are published in the May 31 edition of the journal Science, indicate radiation exposure for human explorers could exceed NASA's career limit for astronauts if current propulsion systems are used.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Two forms of radiation pose potential health risks to astronauts in deep space. One is galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), particles caused by supernova explosions and other high-energy events outside the solar system. The other is solar energetic particles (SEPs) associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections from the sun.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Radiation exposure is measured in units of Sievert (Sv) or milliSievert (one one-thousandth Sv). Long-term population studies have shown exposure to radiation increases a person's lifetime cancer risk. Exposure to a dose of 1 Sv, accumulated over time, is associated with a five percent increase in risk for developing fatal cancer.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>NASA has established a three percent increased risk of fatal cancer as an acceptable career limit for its astronauts currently operating in low-Earth orbit. The RAD data showed the Curiosity rover was exposed to an average of 1.8 milliSieverts of GCR per day on its journey to Mars. Only about three percent of the radiation dose was associated with solar particles because of a relatively quiet solar cycle and the shielding provided by the spacecraft. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The RAD data will help inform current discussions in the United States' medical community, which is working to establish exposure limits for deep-space explorers in the future. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"In terms of accumulated dose, it's like getting a whole-body CT scan once every five or six days,\" said Cary Zeitlin, a principal scientist at the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in San Antonio and lead author of the paper on the findings. \"Understanding the radiation environment inside a spacecraft carrying humans to Mars or other deep space destinations is critical for planning future crewed missions.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Current spacecraft shield much more effectively against SEPs than GCRs. To protect against the comparatively low energy of typical SEPs, astronauts might need to move into havens with extra shielding on a spacecraft or on the Martian surface, or employ other countermeasures. GCRs tend to be highly energetic, highly penetrating particles that are not stopped by the modest shielding provided by a typical spacecraft. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Scientists need to validate theories and models with actual measurements, which RAD is now providing,\" said Donald M. Hassler, a program director at SwRI and principal investigator of the RAD investigation. \"These measurements will be used to better understand how radiation travels through deep space and how it is affected and changed by the spacecraft structure itself. The spacecraft protects somewhat against lower energy particles, but others can propagate through the structure unchanged or break down into secondary particles.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>After Curiosity landed on Mars in August, the RAD instrument continued operating, measuring the radiation environment on the planet's surface. RAD data collected during Curiosity's science mission will continue to inform plans to protect astronauts as NASA designs future missions to Mars in the coming decades. </p>\n",

      "NASA's Curiosity rover found evidence for an ancient, flowing stream on Mars at a few sites, including the rock outcrop pictured here, which the science team has named \"Hottah\" after Hottah Lake in Canada's Northwest Territories.\n",

      "</div>PASADENA, Calif. - Detailed analysis and review have borne out researchers' initial interpretation of pebble-containing slabs that NASA's Mars rover Curiosity investigated last year: They are part of an ancient streambed.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The rocks are the first ever found on Mars that contain streambed gravels. The sizes and shapes of the gravels embedded in these conglomerate rocks -- from the size of sand particles to the size of golf balls -- enabled researchers to calculate the depth and speed of the water that once flowed at this location.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We completed more rigorous quantification of the outcrops to characterize the size distribution and roundness of the pebbles and sand that make up these conglomerates,\" said Rebecca Williams of the Planetary Science Institute, Tucson, Ariz., lead author of a report about them in the journal Science this week. \"We ended up with a calculation in the same range as our initial estimate last fall. At a minimum, the stream was flowing at a speed equivalent to a walking pace -- a meter, or three feet, per second -- and it was ankle-deep to hip-deep.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Three pavement-like rocks examined with the telephoto capability of Curiosity's Mast Camera (Mastcam) during the rover's first 40 days on Mars are the basis for the new report.  One, \"Goulburn,\" is immediately adjacent to the rover's \"Bradbury Landing\" touchdown site.  The other two, \"Link\" and \"Hottah,\" are about 165 and 330 feet (50 and 100 meters) to the southeast. Researchers also used the rover's laser-shooting Chemistry and Camera (ChemCam) instrument to investigate the Link rock. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"These conglomerates look amazingly like streambed deposits on Earth,\" Williams said. \"Most people are familiar with rounded river pebbles. Maybe you've picked up a smoothed, round rock to skip across the water. Seeing something so familiar on another world is exciting and also gratifying.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The larger pebbles are not distributed evenly in the conglomerate rocks. In Hottah, researchers detected alternating pebble-rich layers and sand layers. This is common in streambed deposits on Earth and provides additional evidence for stream flow on Mars. In addition, many of the pebbles are touching each other, a sign that they rolled along the bed of a stream.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Our analysis of the amount of rounding of the pebbles provided further information,\" said Sanjeev Gupta of Imperial College, London, a co-author of the new report. \"The rounding indicates sustained flow. It occurs as pebbles hit each other multiple times. This wasn't a one-off flow. It was sustained, certainly more than weeks or months, though we can't say exactly how long.\"\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />The stream carried the gravels at least a few miles, or kilometers, the researchers estimated. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The atmosphere of modern Mars is too thin to make a sustained stream flow of water possible, though the planet holds large quantities of water ice. Several types of evidence have indicated that ancient Mars had diverse environments with liquid water. However, none but these rocks found by Curiosity could provide the type of stream flow information published this week. Curiosity's images of conglomerate rocks indicate that atmospheric conditions at Gale Crater once enabled the flow of liquid water on the Martian surface.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>During a two-year prime mission, researchers are using Curiosity's 10 science instruments to assess the environmental history in Gale Crater on Mars, where the rover has found evidence of ancient environmental conditions favorable for microbial life. </p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>The fractured rock, called \"Esperance,\" provides evidence about a wet ancient environment possibly favorable for life. The mission's principal investigator, Steve Squyres of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., said, \"Esperance was so important, we committed several weeks to getting this one measurement of it, even though we knew the clock was ticking.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The mission's engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., had set this week as a deadline for starting a drive toward \"Solander Point,\" where the team plans to keep Opportunity working during its next Martian winter.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"What's so special about Esperance is that there was enough water not only for reactions that produced clay minerals, but also enough to flush out ions set loose by those reactions, so that Opportunity can clearly see the alteration,\" said Scott McLennan of the State University of New York, Stony Brook, a long-term planner for Opportunity's science team. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This rock's composition is unlike any other Opportunity has investigated during nine years on Mars -- higher in aluminum and silica, lower in calcium and iron.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The next destination, Solander Point, and the area Opportunity is leaving, Cape York, both are segments of the rim of Endeavour Crater, which spans 14 miles (22 kilometers) across. The planned driving route to Solander Point is about 1.4 miles (2.2 kilometers). Cape York has been Opportunity's home since the rover arrived at the western edge of Endeavour in mid-2011 after a two-year trek from a smaller crater.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Based on our current solar-array dust models, we intend to reach an area of 15 degrees northerly tilt before Opportunity's sixth Martian winter,\" said JPL's Scott Lever, mission manager. \"Solander Point gives us that tilt and may allow us to move around quite a bit for winter science observations.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Northerly tilt increases output from the rover's solar panels during southern-hemisphere winter. Daily sunshine for Opportunity will reach winter minimum in February 2014. The rover needs to be on a favorable slope well before then.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The first drive away from Esperance covered 81.7 feet (24.9 meters) on May 14. Three days earlier, Opportunity finished exposing a patch of the rock's interior with the rock abrasion tool. The team used a camera and spectrometer on the robotic arm to examine Esperance.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The team identified Esperance while exploring a portion of Cape York where the Compact Reconnaissance Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter had detected a clay mineral. Clays typically form in wet environments that are not harshly acidic. For years, Opportunity had been finding evidence for ancient wet environments that were very acidic. The CRISM findings prompted the rover team to investigate the area where clay had been detected from orbit. There, they found an outcrop called \"Whitewater Lake,\" containing a small amount of clay from alteration by exposure to water. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"There appears to have been extensive, but weak, alteration of Whitewater Lake, but intense alteration of Esperance along fractures that provided conduits for fluid flow,\" Squyres said. \"Water that moved through fractures during this rock's history would have provided more favorable conditions for biology than any other wet environment recorded in rocks Opportunity has seen.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Project launched Opportunity to Mars on July 7, 2003, about a month after its twin rover, Spirit.

      "\n",
      "<p>Researchers have identified 248 new impact sites on parts of the Martian surface in the past decade, using images from the spacecraft to determine when the craters appeared. The 200-per-year planetwide estimate is a calculation based on the number found in a systematic survey of a portion of the planet. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The orbiter's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera took pictures of the fresh craters at sites where before-and-after images by other cameras bracketed when the impacts occurred. This combination provided a new way to make direct measurements of the impact rate on Mars. This will lead to better age estimates of recent features on Mars, some of which may have been the result of climate change.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />\"It's exciting to find these new craters right after they form,\" said Ingrid Daubar of the University of Arizona, Tucson, lead author of the paper published online this month by the journal Icarus. \"It reminds you Mars is an active planet, and we can study processes that are happening today.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>These asteroids, or comet fragments, typically are no more than 3 to 6 feet (1 to 2 meters) in diameter. Space rocks too small to reach the ground on Earth cause craters on Mars because the Red Planet has a much thinner atmosphere. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>HiRISE targeted places where dark spots had appeared during the time between images taken by the spacecraft's Context Camera (CTX) or cameras on other orbiters. The new estimate of cratering rate is based on a portion of the 248 new craters detected. It comes from a systematic check of a dusty fraction of the planet with CTX since late 2006. The impacts disturb the dust, creating noticeable blast zones. In this part of the research, 44 fresh impact sites were identified.</p>\n",

      "<br />Estimates of the rate at which new craters appear serve as scientists' best yardstick for estimating the ages of exposed landscape surfaces on Mars and other worlds.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Daubar and co-authors calculated a rate for how frequently new craters at least 12.8 feet (3.9 meters) in diameter are excavated. The rate is equivalent to an average of one each year on each area of the Martian surface roughly the size of the U.S. state of Texas. Earlier estimates pegged the cratering rate at three to 10 times more craters per year. They were based on studies of craters on the moon and the ages of lunar rocks collected during NASA's Apollo missions in the late 1960s and early 1970s.</p>\n",

      "<p>This second drilling target, called \"Cumberland,\" lies about nine feet (2.75 meters) west of the rock where Curiosity's drill first touched Martian stone in February. Curiosity took the first rock sample ever collected on Mars from that rock, called \"John Klein.\" The rover found evidence of an ancient environment favorable for microbial life. Both rocks are flat, with pale veins and a bumpy surface. They are embedded in a layer of rock on the floor of a shallow depression called \"Yellowknife Bay.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>This second drilling is intended to confirm results from the first drilling, which indicated the chemistry of the first powdered sample from John Klein was much less oxidizing than that of a soil sample the rover scooped up before it began drilling. </p>\n",

      "<p>\"We know there is some cross-contamination from the previous sample each time,\" said Dawn Sumner, a long-term planner for Curiosity's science team at the University of California at Davis. \"For the Cumberland sample, we expect to have most of that cross-contamination come from a similar rock, rather than from very different soil.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Although Cumberland and John Klein are very similar, Cumberland appears to have more of the erosion-resistant granules that cause the surface bumps. The bumps are concretions, or clumps of minerals, which formed when water soaked the rock long ago. Analysis of a sample containing more material from these concretions could provide information about the variability within the rock layer that includes both John Klein and Cumberland.</p>\n",

      "<p>In 1971, the former Soviet Union launched the Mars 2 and Mars 3 missions to Mars. Each consisted of an orbiter plus a lander.

      "<p>Vitali Egorov from St. Petersburg, Russia, heads the largest Russian Internet community about Curiosity, at <a href=\"http://vk.com/curiosity_live\">http://vk.com/curiosity_live</a> . His subscribers did the preliminary search for Mars 3 via crowdsourcing. Egorov modeled what Mars 3 hardware pieces should look like in a HiRISE image, and the group carefully searched the many small features in this large image, finding what appear to be viable candidates in the southern part of the scene. Each candidate has a size and shape consistent with the expected hardware, and they are arranged on the surface as expected from the entry, descent and landing sequence.  </p>\n",

      "<p>\"I wanted to attract people's attention to the fact that Mars exploration today is available to practically anyone,\" Egorov said. \"At the same time we were able to connect with the history of our country, which we were reminded of after many years through the images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>An advisor to the group, Alexander Basilevsky, of Vernadsky Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry, Moscow, contacted McEwen suggesting a follow-up image. HiRISE acquired the follow-up on March 10, 2013. This image was targeted to cover some of the hardware candidates in color and to get a second look with different illumination angles. Meanwhile, Basilevsky and Erogov contacted Russian engineers and scientists who worked on Mars 3 for more information.   </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The candidate parachute is the most distinctive feature in the images. It is an especially bright spot for this region, about 8.2 yards (7.5 meters) in diameter. The parachute would have a diameter of 12 yards (11 meters) if fully spread out over the surface, so this is consistent. In the second HiRISE image, the parachute appears to have brightened over much of its surface, probably due to its better illumination over the sloping surface, but it is also possible that the parachute brightened in the intervening years because dust was removed.  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The descent module, or retrorocket, was attached to the lander container by a chain, and the candidate feature has the right size and even shows a linear extension that could be a chain.

      "</div>VIENNA -- Mars has lost much of its original atmosphere, but what's left remains quite active, recent findings from NASA's Mars rover Curiosity indicate. Rover team members reported diverse findings today at the European Geosciences Union 2013 General Assembly, in Vienna.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />Evidence has strengthened this month that Mars lost much of its original atmosphere by a process of gas escaping from the top of the atmosphere.  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument analyzed an atmosphere sample last week using a process that concentrates selected gases. The results provided the most precise measurements ever made of isotopes of argon in the Martian atmosphere. Isotopes are variants of the same element with different atomic weights. \"We found arguably the clearest and most robust signature of atmospheric loss on Mars,\" said Sushil Atreya, a SAM co-investigator at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>SAM found that the Martian atmosphere has about four times as much of a lighter stable isotope (argon-36) compared to a heavier one (argon-38). This removes previous uncertainty about the ratio in the Martian atmosphere from 1976 measurements from NASA's Viking project and from small volumes of argon extracted from Martian meteorites. The ratio is much lower than the solar system's original ratio, as estimated from argon-isotope measurements of the sun and Jupiter. This points to a process at Mars that favored preferential loss of the lighter isotope over the heavier one.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity measures several variables in today's Martian atmosphere with the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS), provided by Spain. While daily air temperature has climbed steadily since the measurements began eight months ago and is not strongly tied to the rover's location, humidity has differed significantly at different places along the rover's route. These are the first systematic measurements of humidity on Mars. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Trails of dust devils have not been seen inside Gale Crater, but REMS sensors detected many whirlwind patterns during the first hundred Martian days of the mission, though not as many as detected in the same length of time by earlier missions. \"A whirlwind is a very quick event that happens in a few seconds and should be verified by a combination of pressure, temperature and wind oscillations and, in some cases, a decrease is ultraviolet radiation,\" said REMS Principal Investigator Javier Gómez-Elvira of the Centro de Astrobiología, Madrid.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Dust distributed by the wind has been examined by Curiosity's laser-firing Chemistry and Camera (ChemCam) instrument. Initial laser pulses on each target hit dust. The laser's energy removes the dust to expose underlying material, but those initial pulses also provide information about the dust.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We knew that Mars is red because of iron oxides in the dust,\" said ChemCam Deputy Principal Investigator Sylvestre Maurice of the Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Planétologie in Toulouse, France. \"ChemCam reveals a complex chemical composition of the dust that includes hydrogen, which could be in the form of hydroxyl groups or water molecules.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Possible interchange of water molecules between the atmosphere and the ground is studied by a combination of instruments on the rover, including the Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN), provided by Russia under the leadership of DAN Principal Investigator Igor Mitrofanov.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />For the rest of April, Curiosity will carry out daily activities for which commands were sent in March, using DAN, REMS and the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD). No new commands are being sent during a four-week period while Mars is passing nearly behind the sun, from Earth's perspective. This geometry occurs about every 26 months and is called Mars solar conjunction.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"After conjunction, Curiosity will be drilling into another rock where the rover is now, but that target has not yet been selected. The science team will discuss this over the conjunction period.\" said Mars Science Laboratory Project Scientist John Grotzinger, of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>NASA's Mars Science Laboratory Project is using Curiosity to investigate the environmental history within Gale Crater, a location where the project has found that conditions were long ago favorable for microbial life.

      "\n",
      "<p>NGIMS is mounted on an articulated payload platform that can be pointed independently from the spacecraft. The instrument will measure the composition of neutral and ionized gases in the upper atmosphere as the spacecraft passes through it on each orbit and will determine the basic properties of the upper atmosphere.

Today there are three active satellites circling the red planet while two rovers, Opportunity and Curiosity, wheel across the red sands below. Mars is dry, barren, and apparently lifeless.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Soon, those assets could find themselves exploring a very different kind of world.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"There is a small but non-negligible chance that Comet 2013 A1 will strike Mars next year in October of 2014,\" says Don Yeomans of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program at JPL. \"Current solutions put the odds of impact at 1 in 2000.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The nucleus of the comet is probably 1 to 3 km in diameter, and it is coming in fast, around 56 km/s (125,000 mph). \"It if does hit Mars, it would deliver as much energy as 35 million megatons of TNT,\" estimates Yeomans.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>For comparison, the asteroid strike that ended the dinosaurs on Earth 65 million years ago was about three times as powerful, 100 million megatons. Another point of comparison is the meteor that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in February of 2013, damaging buildings and knocking people down. The Mars comet is packing 80 million times more energy than that relatively puny asteroid.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>An impact wouldn't necessarily mean the end of NASA's Mars program. But it would transform the program-- along with Mars itself.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"I think of it as a giant climate experiment,\" says Michael Meyer, lead scientist for the Mars Exploration Program at NASA headquarters. \"An impact would loft a lot of stuff into the Martian atmosphere--dust, sand, water and other debris. The result could be a warmer, wetter Mars than we're accustomed to today.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Meyer worries that solar-powered Opportunity might have a hard time surviving if the atmosphere became opaque. Nuclear-powered Curiosity, though, would carry on just fine. He also notes that Mars orbiters might have trouble seeing the surface, for a while at least, until the debris begins to clear.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A direct impact remains unlikely. Paul Chodas of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program stresses that a 1 in 2000 chance of impact means there's a 1999 in 2000 chance of no impact. \"A near-miss is far more likely,\" he points out.</p>\n",

      "</figure>\n",
      "</div>Even a near miss is a potentially big event. The latest orbit solutions put the comet somewhere within 300,000 km of the red planet at closest approach. That means Mars could find itself inside the comet's gassy, dusty atmosphere or \"coma.\" Visually, the comet would reach 0th magnitude, that is, a few times brighter than a 1st magnitude star, as seen from the Red Planet.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Cameras on ALL of NASA's spacecraft currently operating at Mars should be able to take photographs of Comet 2013 A1,\" says Jim Bell, a planetary scientist and Mars imaging specialist at Arizona State University. \"The issue with Mars Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will be the ability to point them in the right direction; they are used to looking down, not up. Mission designers will have to figure out if that is possible.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The issue with the Opportunity and Curiosity rovers will be power for imaging at night,\" he continues. \"Opportunity is solar powered and so would need to dip into reserve battery power to operate the cameras at night. Whether or not we will be able to do this will depend on how much power the rover is getting from dusty solar panels in the daytime. On the other hand, Curiosity is nuclear powered, so it could have better odds at night-time imaging.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Researchers will be keenly interested to see how the comet's atmosphere interacts with the atmosphere of Mars. For one thing, there could be a meteor shower. \"Analyzing the spectrum of disintegrating meteors could tell us something interesting about the chemistry of the upper atmosphere,\" notes Meyer.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Another possibility is Martian auroras. Unlike Earth, which has a global magnetic field that wraps around our entire planet, Mars is only magnetized in patches. Here and there, magnetic umbrellas sprout out of the ground, creating a crazy-quilt of magnetic poles concentrated mainly in the southern hemisphere. Ionized gases hitting the top of the Martian atmosphere could spark auroras in the canopies of the magnetic umbrellas.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Even before the comet flyby was known, NASA had already decided to send a spacecraft to Mars to study the dynamics of the Martian atmosphere. If the probe, named MAVEN (short for \"Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution\"), is launched on time in November 2013, it would reach Mars just a few weeks before the comet in 2014.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>However, notes MAVEN's principal investigator Bruce Jakosky of the University of Colorado, the spacecraft won't be ready to observe the comet when it reaches Mars. \"It takes a while to get into our science mapping orbit, deploy the booms, turn on and test the science instruments--and so on,\" he explains. \"MAVEN won't be fully operational until perhaps two weeks after the comet passes.

      "<p>When the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission begins its journey to the Red Planet in 2013, it will carry a sensitive magnetic-field instrument built and tested by a team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Scheduled for launch in late 2013, MAVEN will be the first mission devoted to understanding the Martian upper atmosphere. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The goal of MAVEN is to determine the history of the loss of atmospheric gases to space through time, providing answers about Mars' climate evolution. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>By measuring the current rate of escape to space and gathering enough information about the relevant processes, scientists will be able to infer how the planet's atmosphere evolved.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The trip to Mars takes 10 months, and MAVEN will go into orbit around the planet in September 2014.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Goddard-built MAVEN magnetometer will be a sensitive tool investigating what remains of the Red Planet's magnetic \"shield.\" It will play a key role in studying the planet's atmosphere and interactions with solar wind, helping answer the question of why a planet once thought to have an abundance of liquid water became a frozen desert. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The MAVEN magnetometer is key to unraveling the nature of the interactions between the solar wind and the planet,\" said MAVEN principal investigator Bruce Jakosky from University of Colorado at Boulder's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (CU/LASP). </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The magnetometer will measure the planet's magnetic field through a series of coils, each containing a magnetic ring wrapped around a metal core. The sensors, known as \"flux gates,\" are driven in and out of saturation by applied magnetic fields. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>If there is no ambient magnetic field, the sensors remain balanced. If there is an ambient field present, the sensors will go into saturation more quickly in one direction than the other. It's the imbalance that reveals the presence of an ambient field.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"A magnetometer is like an electronic compass,\" said Jack Connerney, mission co-investigator at Goddard. \"But we measure the strength, as well as the direction, of the magnetic field.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The importance of studying the planet's magnetic field is rooted in the theory that Mars lost its global magnetic field billions of years ago, allowing the solar wind to strip the atmosphere and dry out the planet. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Unlike Earth's global magnetic field, which surrounds the entire planet, Mars only has patches of magnetic field left in its crust. This can create pockets of atmosphere that are protected against solar wind and others that are left vulnerable. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>By measuring sections of the planet's magnetic field, the magnetometer could help scientists create a bigger picture of the planet's overall atmosphere. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The magnetometer helps us see where the atmosphere is protected by mini-magnetospheres and where it's open to solar wind,\" Connerney said. \"We can study the solar wind impact and how efficient it is at stripping the atmosphere.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The magnetometer is one of six instruments that make up the Particles and Fields Package, being assembled by team members at the University of California, Berkeley. The magnetometer works with the other instruments from this package to gather data throughout the course of the projected yearlong orbit around the planet. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The spacecraft will go into orbit and pass closely over the planet's surface and then move further away to study solar wind beyond the planet's influence.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The magnetometer is a very sensitive instrument, so engineers have to work to ensure the instrument doesn't accidentally measure the spacecraft's magnetic field instead of the one the planet produces. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We have to go to great extremes to be sure that we have minimized any magnetic fields from the spacecraft,\" Jakosky said. \"We are working hard to build a very 'magnetically clean' spacecraft that will meet our needs with regard to the magnetometer.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The MAVEN principal investigator comes from CU/LASP. The university provides science operations, is building science instruments, and leads education/public outreach. NASA Goddard manages the project and is building two of the science instruments for the mission. Lockheed Martin of Littleton, Colo., is building the spacecraft and is responsible for mission operations.

      "\n",
      "<p>The powder delivered on Saturday came from the rover's first full drilling into a rock to collect a sample. The new portion went into the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument inside the rover, which began analyzing this material and had previously analyzed other portions from the same drilling. SAM can analyze samples in several different ways, so multiple portions from the same drilling are useful.</p>\n",

      "<p>Like many spacecraft, Curiosity carries a pair of main computers, redundant to each other, to have a backup available if one fails. Each of the computers, A-side and B-side, also has other redundant subsystems linked to just that computer. Curiosity is now operating on its B-side, as it did during part of the flight from Earth to Mars. The A-side was most recently used starting a few weeks before landing and continuing until Feb. 28, when engineers commanded a switch to the B-side in response to a memory glitch on the A-side.  The A-side now is available as a backup if needed.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>One aspect of ramping-up activities after switching to the B-side computer has been to check the six engineering cameras that are hard-linked to that computer.  The rover's science instruments, including five science cameras, can each be operated by either the A-side or B-side computer, whichever is active.  However, each of Curiosity's 12 engineering cameras is linked to just one of the computers. The engineering cameras are the Navigation Camera (Navcam), the Front Hazard-Avoidance Camera (Front Hazcam) and Rear Hazard-Avoidance Camera (Rear Hazcam). Each of those three named cameras has four cameras on it: two stereo pairs of cameras, with one pair linked to each computer. Only the pairs linked to the active computer can be used, and the A-side computer was active from before landing, in August, until Feb. 28.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"This was the first use of the B-side engineering cameras since April 2012, on the way to Mars,\" said JPL's Justin Maki, team lead for these cameras. \"Now we've used them on Mars for the first time, and they've all checked out OK.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Engineers quickly diagnosed a software issue that prompted Curiosity to put itself into a precautionary standby \"safe mode\" on March 16, and they know how to prevent it from happening again. The rover stayed on its B-side while it was in safe mode and subsequently as science activities resumed.</p>\n",

      "<p>Mars will be passing almost directly behind the sun, from Earth's perspective. The sun can easily disrupt radio transmissions between the two planets during that near-alignment. To prevent an impaired command from reaching an orbiter or rover, mission controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., are preparing to suspend sending any commands to spacecraft at Mars for weeks in April. Transmissions from Mars to Earth will also be reduced.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The travels of Earth and Mars around the sun set up this arrangement, called a Mars solar conjunction, about once every 26 months.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"This is our sixth conjunction for Odyssey,\" said Chris Potts of JPL, mission manager for NASA's Mars Odyssey, which has been orbiting Mars since 2001. \"We have plenty of useful experience dealing with them, though each conjunction is a little different.\"  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Mars solar conjunctions that occur once about every 26 months are not identical to each other.  They can differ in exactly how close to directly behind the sun Mars gets, and they can differ in how active the sun is. The sun's activity, in terms of sunspots and solar flares, varies on a 22-year cycle. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This year, the apparent angle between Mars and the sun (if you could see Mars against the glare of the sun--but don't try, because it's dangerous to the eyes) will slim to 0.4 degree on April 17. The sun is in a more active period of solar flares for its current cycle, compared to the 2011 conjunction, but this cycle has been relatively mild.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The biggest difference for this 2013 conjunction is having Curiosity on Mars,\" Potts said. Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter relay almost all data coming from Curiosity and the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity, as well as conducting the orbiters' own science observations.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Transmissions from Earth to the orbiters will be suspended while Mars and the sun are two degrees or less apart in the sky, from April 9 to 26, with restricted commanding during additional days before and after. Both orbiters will continue science observations on a reduced basis compared to usual operations. Both will receive and record data from the rovers. Odyssey will continue transmissions Earthward throughout April, although engineers anticipate some data dropouts, and the recorded data will be retransmitted later.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will go into a record-only mode on April 4. \"For the entire conjunction period, we'll just be storing data on board,\" said Deputy Mission Manager Reid Thomas of JPL. He anticipates that the orbiter could have about 40 gigabits of data from its own science instruments and about 12 gigabits of data from Curiosity accumulated for sending to Earth around May 1. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity is approaching its fifth solar conjunction. Its team will send no commands between April 9 and April 26. The rover will continue science activities using a long-term set of commands to be sent beforehand. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We are doing extra science planning work this month to develop almost three weeks of activity sequences for Opportunity to execute throughout conjunction,\" said Opportunity Mission Manager Alfonso Herrera of JPL. The activities during the conjunction period will not include any driving. </p>\n",

      "<p>Last week, the rover's science team announced that analysis of powder from a drilled mudstone rock on Mars indicates past environmental conditions that were favorable for microbial life. Additional findings presented today (March 18) at a news briefing at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas, suggest those conditions extended beyond the site of the drilling.</p>\n",

      "<p>Using infrared-imaging capability of a camera on the rover and an instrument that shoots neutrons into the ground to probe for hydrogen, researchers have found more hydration of minerals near the clay-bearing rock than at locations Curiosity visited earlier. </p>\n",

      "<p>The rover's Mast Camera (Mastcam) can also serve as a mineral-detecting and hydration-detecting tool, reported Jim Bell of Arizona State University, Tempe. \"Some iron-bearing rocks and minerals can be detected and mapped using the Mastcam's near-infrared filters.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Ratios of brightness in different Mastcam near-infrared wavelengths can indicate the presence of some hydrated minerals.

At the rover's very dry study area on Mars, the detected hydrogen is mainly in water molecules bound into minerals. \"We definitely see signal variation along the traverse from the landing point to Yellowknife Bay,\" said DAN Deputy Principal Investigator Maxim Litvak of the Space Research Institute, Moscow.  \"More water is detected at Yellowknife Bay than earlier on the route. Even within Yellowknife Bay, we see significant variation.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>Findings presented today from the Canadian-made Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) on Curiosity's arm indicate that the wet environmental processes that produced clay at Yellowknife Bay did so without much change in the overall mix of chemical elements present. The elemental composition of the outcrop Curiosity drilled into matches the composition of basalt. For example, it has basalt-like proportions of silicon, aluminum, magnesium and iron. Basalt is the most common rock type on Mars. It is igneous, but it is also thought to be the parent material for sedimentary rocks Curiosity has examined.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The elemental composition of rocks in Yellowknife Bay wasn't changed much by mineral alteration,\" said Curiosity science team member Mariek Schmidt of Brock University, Saint Catharines, Ontario, Canada. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A dust coating on rocks had made the composition detected by APXS not quite a match for basalt until Curiosity used a brush to sweep the dust away. After that, APXS saw less sulfur. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"By removing the dust, we've got a better reading that pushes the classification toward basaltic composition,\" Schmidt said. The sedimentary rocks at Yellowknife Bay likely formed when original basaltic rocks were broken into fragments, transported, re-deposited as sedimentary particles, and mineralogically altered by exposure to water.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>Clues to this habitable environment come from data returned by the rover's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) and Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instruments. The data indicate the Yellowknife Bay area the rover is exploring was the end of an ancient river system or an intermittently wet lake bed that could have provided chemical energy and other favorable conditions for microbes. The rock is made up of a fine-grained mudstone containing clay minerals, sulfate minerals and other chemicals. This ancient wet environment, unlike some others on Mars, was not harshly oxidizing, acidic or extremely salty. </p>\n",

      "</div>PASADENA, Calif. -- NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has provided images allowing scientists for the first time to create a 3-D reconstruction of ancient water channels below the Martian surface. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The spacecraft took numerous images during the past few years that showed channels attributed to catastrophic flooding in the last 500 million years. During this period, Mars had been otherwise considered cold and dry. These channels are essential to understanding the extent to which recent hydrologic activity prevailed during such arid conditions. They also help scientists determine whether the floods could have induced episodes of climate change. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The estimated size of the flooding appears to be comparable to the ancient mega-flood that created the Channeled Scablands in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, in eastern Washington. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The findings are reported in the March 7 issue of Science Express by a team of scientists from NASA, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, and the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Our findings show the scale of erosion that created the channels previously was underestimated and the channel depth was at least twice that of previous approximations,\" said Gareth Morgan, a geologist at the National Air and Space Museum's Center for Earth and Planetary Studies in Washington and lead author on the paper. \"This work demonstrates the importance of orbital sounding radar in understanding how water has shaped the surface of Mars.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The channels lie in Elysium Planitia, an expanse of plains along the Martian equator and the youngest volcanic region on the planet. Extensive volcanism throughout the last several hundred million years covered most of the surface of Elysium Planitia, and this buried evidence of Mars' older geologic history, including the source and most of the length of the 620-mile-long (1000-kilometer-long) Marte Vallis channel system. To probe the length, width and depth of these underground channels, the researchers used the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's Shallow Radar (SHARAD).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Marte Vallis' morphology is similar to more ancient channel systems on Mars, especially those of the Chryse basin. Many scientists think the Chryse channels likely were formed by the catastrophic release of ground water, although others suggest lava can produce many of the same features. In comparison, little is known about Marte Vallis. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>With the SHARAD radar, the team was able to map the buried channels in three dimensions with enough detail to see evidence suggesting two different phases of channel formation. One phase etched a series of smaller branching, or \"anastomosing,\" channels that are now on a raised \"bench\" next to the main channel. These smaller channels flowed around four streamlined islands. A second phase carved the deep, wide channels.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"In this region, the radar picked up multiple 'reflectors,' which are surfaces or boundaries that reflect radio waves, so it was possible to see multiple layers, \" said Lynn Carter, the paper's co-author from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. \"We have rarely seen that in SHARAD data outside of the polar ice regions of Mars.\" \n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />The mapping also provided sufficient information to establish the floods that carved the channels originated from a now-buried portion of the Cerberus Fossae fracture system. The water could have accumulated in an underground reservoir and been released by tectonic or volcanic activity. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"While the radar was probing thick layers of dry, solid rock, it provided us with unique information about the recent history of water in a key region of Mars,\" said co-author Jeffrey Plaut of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.</p>\n",

The NEO Program Office's current estimate based on observations through March 1, 2013, has it passing about 31,000 miles (50,000 kilometers) from the Red Planet's surface.

      "\n",
      "<p>The rover carried out this \"pre-load\" testing on Mars yesterday (Jan. 27). The tests enable engineers to check whether the amount of force applied to the hardware matches predictions for what would result from the commanded motions. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The next step is an overnight pre-load test, to gain assurance that the large temperature change from day to night at the rover's location does not add excessively to stress on the arm while it is pressing on the drill. At Curiosity's work site in Gale Crater, air temperature plunges from about 32 degrees Fahrenheit (zero degrees Celsius) in the afternoon to minus 85 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 65 degrees Celsius) overnight. Over this temperature swing, this large rover's arm, chassis and mobility system grow and shrink by about a tenth of an inch (about 2.4 millimeters), a little more than the thickness of a U.S. quarter-dollar coin. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The rover team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., sent the rover commands yesterday to begin the overnight pre-load test today (Monday).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We don't plan on leaving the drill in a rock overnight once we start drilling, but in case that happens, it is important to know what to expect in terms of stress on the hardware,\" said JPL's Daniel Limonadi, the lead systems engineer for Curiosity's surface sampling and science system. \"This test is done at lower pre-load values than we plan to use during drilling, to let us learn about the temperature effects without putting the hardware at risk.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Remaining preparatory steps will take at least the rest of this week. Some of these steps are hardware checks. Others will evaluate characteristics of the rock material at the selected drilling site on a patch of flat, veined rock called \"John Klein.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Limonadi said, \"We are proceeding with caution in the approach to Curiosity's first drilling. This is challenging. It will be the first time any robot has drilled into a rock to collect a sample on Mars.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>An activity called the \"drill-on-rock checkout\" will use the hammering action of Curiosity's drill briefly, without rotation of the drill bit, for assurance that the back-and-forth percussion mechanism and associated control system are properly tuned for hitting a rock.  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A subsequent activity called \"mini-drill\" is designed to produce a small ring of tailings -- powder resulting from drilling -- on the surface of the rock while penetrating less than eight-tenths of an inch (2 centimeters). This activity will not go deep enough to push rock powder into the drill's sample-gathering chamber.  Limonadi said, \"The purpose is to see whether the tailings are behaving the way we expect. Do they look like dry powder? That's what we want to confirm.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The rover team's activities this week are affected by the difference between Mars time and Earth time. To compensate for this, the team develops commands based on rover activities from two sols earlier. So, for example, the mini-drill activity cannot occur sooner than two sols after the drill-on-rock checkout.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Each Martian sol lasts about 40 minutes longer than a 24-hour Earth day. By mid-February, the afternoon at Gale Crater, when Curiosity transmits information about results from the sol, will again be falling early enough in the California day for the rover team to plan each sol based on the previous sol's results. </p>\n",

      "</div>PASADENA, Calif. -- Researchers using NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter see seasonal changes on far-northern Martian sand dunes caused by warming of a winter blanket of frozen carbon dioxide.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Earth has no naturally frozen carbon dioxide, though pieces of manufactured carbon-dioxide ice, called \"dry ice,\" sublime directly from solid to gas on Earth, just as the vast blankets of dry ice do on Mars. A driving factor in the springtime changes where seasonal coverings of dry ice form on Mars is that thawing occurs at the underside of the ice sheet, where it is in contact with dark ground being warmed by early-spring sunshine through translucent ice. The trapped gas builds up pressure and breaks out in various ways.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Transient grooves form on dunes when gas trapped under the ice blanket finds an escape point and whooshes out, carrying out sand with it. The expelled sand forms dark fans or streaks on top of the ice layer at first, but this evidence disappears with the seasonal ice, and summer winds erase most of the grooves in the dunes before the next winter. The grooves are smaller features than the gullies that earlier research linked to carbon-dioxide sublimation on steeper dune slopes.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Similar activity has been documented and explained previously where seasonal sheets of frozen carbon dioxide form and thaw near Mars' south pole. Details of the different northern seasonal changes are newly reported in a set of three papers for the journal Icarus. A video showing some of the changes is online at <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mro/multimedia/videos/index.cfm?v=114\">http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mro/multimedia/videos/index.cfm?v=114</a> .</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The findings reinforce growing appreciation that Mars today, however different from its former self, is still a dynamic world, and however similar to Earth in some respects, displays some quite unearthly processes. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"It's an amazingly dynamic process,\" said Candice Hansen of the Planetary Science Institute, Tucson. She is lead author of the first of the three new reports. \"We had this old paradigm that all the action on Mars was billions of years ago. Thanks to the ability to monitor changes with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, one of the new paradigms is that Mars has many active processes today.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>With three Martian years (six Earth years) of data in hand from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera, the researchers report on the sequence and variety of seasonal changes. The spring changes include outbursts of gas carrying sand, polygonal cracking of the winter ice blanketing the dunes, sandfalls down the faces of the dunes, and dark fans of sand propelled out onto the ice. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"It is a challenge to catch when and how those changes happen, they are so fast,\" said Ganna Portyankina of the University of Bern in Switzerland, lead author of the second report. \"That's why only now we start to see the bigger picture that both hemispheres actually tell us similar stories.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The process of outrushing gas that carves grooves into the northern dunes resembles the process creating spider-shaped features in far southern Mars, as seen in an image at <a href=\"http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12249\">http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12249</a>, but the spiders have not been seen in the north. The seasonal dry-ice sheets overlie different types of terrain in the two hemispheres. In the south, diverse terrains include the flat, erodible ground where the spiders form, but in the north, a broad band of sand dunes encircles the permanent north polar ice cap. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Another difference is in brightening on parts of the ice-covered dunes. This brightening in the north results from the presence of water-ice frost, while in the south, similar brightening is caused by fresh carbon dioxide. The third paper of the Icarus set, by Antoine Pommerol of the University of Bern and co-authors, reports distribution of the water frost using the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM). The light water frost is blown around by spring winds.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>The new information comes from researchers analyzing spectrometer data from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which looked down on the floor of McLaughlin Crater. The Martian crater is 57 miles (92 kilometers) in diameter and 1.4 miles (2.2 kilometers) deep. McLaughlin's depth apparently once allowed underground water, which otherwise would have stayed hidden, to flow into the crater's interior. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Layered, flat rocks at the bottom of the crater contain carbonate and clay minerals that form in the presence of water. McLaughlin lacks large inflow channels, and small channels originating within the crater wall end near a level that could have marked the surface of a lake. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Together, these new observations suggest the formation of the carbonates and clay in a groundwater-fed lake within the closed basin of the crater. Some researchers propose the crater interior catching the water and the underground zone contributing the water could have been wet environments and potential habitats. The findings are published in Sunday's online edition of Nature Geoscience.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Taken together, the observations in McLaughlin Crater provide the best evidence for carbonate forming within a lake environment instead of being washed into a crater from outside,\" said Joseph Michalski, lead author of the paper, which has five co-authors.

      "<p>\"The MRO team has made a concerted effort to get highly processed data products out to members of the science community like Dr. Michalski for analysis,\" said CRISM Principal Investigator Scott Murchie of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md. \"New results like this show why that effort is so important.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Launched in 2005, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and its six instruments have provided more high-resolution data about the Red Planet than all other Mars orbiters combined. Data are made available for scientists worldwide to research, analyze and report their findings. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"A number of studies using CRISM data have shown rocks exhumed from the subsurface by meteor impact were altered early in Martian history, most likely by hydrothermal fluids,\" Michalski said. \"These fluids trapped in the subsurface could have periodically breached the surface in deep basins such as McLaughlin Crater, possibly carrying clues to subsurface habitability.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>McLaughlin Crater sits at the low end of a regional slope several hundreds of miles, or kilometers, long on the western side of the Arabia Terra region of Mars.

This announcement affirms the agency's commitment to a bold exploration program that meets our nation's scientific and human exploration objectives. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The Obama administration is committed to a robust Mars exploration program,\" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said. \"With this next mission, we're ensuring America remains the world leader in the exploration of the Red Planet, while taking another significant step toward sending humans there in the 2030s.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The planned portfolio includes the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers; two NASA spacecraft and contributions to one European spacecraft currently orbiting Mars; the 2013 launch of the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) orbiter to study the Martian upper atmosphere; the Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) mission, which will take the first look into the deep interior of Mars; and participation in ESA's 2016 and 2018 ExoMars missions, including providing \"Electra\" telecommunication radios to ESA's 2016 mission and a critical element of the premier astrobiology instrument on the 2018 ExoMars rover. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The plan to design and build a new Mars robotic science rover with a launch in 2020 comes only months after the agency announced InSight, which will launch in 2016, bringing a total of seven NASA missions operating or being planned to study and explore our Earth-like neighbor. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The 2020 mission will constitute another step toward being responsive to high-priority science goals and the president's challenge of sending humans to Mars orbit in the 2030s.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The future rover development and design will be based on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) architecture that successfully carried the Curiosity rover to the Martian surface this summer. This will ensure mission costs and risks are as low as possible, while still delivering a highly capable rover with a proven landing system. The mission will constitute a vital component of a broad portfolio of Mars exploration missions in development for the coming decade.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />The mission will advance the science priorities of the National Research Council's 2011 Planetary Science Decadal Survey and responds to the findings of the Mars Program Planning Group established earlier this year to assist NASA in restructuring its Mars Exploration Program. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The challenge to restructure the Mars Exploration Program has turned from the seven minutes of terror for the Curiosity landing to the start of seven years of innovation,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"This mission concept fits within the current and projected Mars exploration budget, builds on the exciting discoveries of Curiosity, and takes advantage of a favorable launch opportunity.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The specific payload and science instruments for the 2020 mission will be openly competed, following the Science Mission Directorate's established processes for instrument selection. This process will begin with the establishment of a science definition team that will be tasked to outline the scientific objectives for the mission. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This mission fits within the five-year budget plan in the president's Fiscal Year 2013 budget request, and is contingent on future appropriations.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Plans also will include opportunities for infusing new capabilities developed through investments by NASA's Space Technology Program, Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, and contributions from international partners.</p>\n",

      "<p>\"If you are a geologist studying a site like this, one of the first things you do is walk the outcrop, and that's what we've done with Opportunity,\" said Steve Squyres, the mission's principal investigator at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Coming up on its ninth anniversary, Opportunity still is a capable robotic explorer. It has been investigating a crater-rim site where observations from orbiting Mars spacecraft detected traces of clay minerals, which form under wet, non-acidic conditions that can be favorable for life. The rover's current activities were presented at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The rover team chose this site as a driving destination years earlier. The site is named Matijevic Hill in honor of the late Jacob Matijevic, who led the engineering team for the twin Mars exploration rovers Spirit and Opportunity for several years. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Opportunity drove about 1,160 feet (354 meters) in a counterclockwise circuit around Matijevic Hill in October and November, bringing the total miles driven on the mission to 22 miles (35.4 kilometers). Researchers used the rover to survey the extent of Matijevic Hill outcrops and identify the best places to investigate further.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We've got a list of questions posed by the observations so far,\" Squyres said. \"We did this walkabout to determine the most efficient use of time to answer the questions. Now we have a good idea what we're dealing with, and we're ready to start the detailed work.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The hill is on the western rim of Endeavour Crater, a bowl 14 miles (22 kilometers) in diameter. An impact from a celestial object dug this crater more than 3 billion years ago, pushing rocks onto the rim from a greater depth than Opportunity reached during its first several years on Mars. Since the impact, those rocks may have been altered by environmental conditions. Sorting out the relative ages of local outcrops is a key to understanding the area's environmental history. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Almost nine years into a mission planned to last for three months, Opportunity is fit and ready for driving, robotic-arm operations and communication with Earth,\" said the mission's deputy project scientist, Diana Blaney, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Two outcrops of high interest on Matijevic Hill are \"Whitewater Lake\" and \"Kirkwood.\" Whitewater Lake is light-toned material that science team members believe may contain clay. Kirkwood contains small spheres with composition, structure and distribution that differ from other iron-rich spherules, nicknamed blueberries, that Opportunity found at its landing site and throughout the Meridiani Planum area it has explored. Squyres calls the Kirkwood spheres \"newberries.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We don't know yet whether Whitewood Lake and Kirkwood are from before or after the crater formed,\" he said. \"One of the most important things to work out is the order and position of the rock layers to tell us the relative ages. We also need more work on the composition of Whitewater and debris shed by Whitewater to understand the clay signature seen from orbit, and on the composition of the newberries to understand how they formed.\"</p>\n",

The specific soil sample came from a drift of windblown dust and sand called \"Rocknest.\" The site lies in a relatively flat part of Gale Crater still miles away from the rover's main destination on the slope of a mountain called Mount Sharp. The rover's laboratory includes the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) suite and the Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instrument. SAM used three methods to analyze gases given off from the dusty sand when it was heated in a tiny oven.

      "<p>Curiosity's team selected Rocknest as the first scooping site because it has fine sand particles suited for scrubbing interior surfaces of the arm's sample-handling chambers.

      "<p>\"Active drifts on Mars look darker on the surface,\" said MAHLI Principal Investigator Ken Edgett, of Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego. \"This is an older drift that has had time to be inactive, letting the crust form and dust accumulate on it.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>CheMin's examination of Rocknest samples found the composition is about half common volcanic minerals and half non-crystalline materials such as glass. SAM added information about ingredients present in much lower concentrations and about ratios of isotopes. Isotopes are different forms of the same element and can provide clues about environmental changes. The water seen by SAM does not mean the drift was wet. Water molecules bound to grains of sand or dust are not unusual, but the quantity seen was higher than anticipated.</p>\n",

      "<p>SAM tentatively identified the oxygen and chlorine compound perchlorate. This is a reactive chemical previously found in arctic Martian soil by NASA's Phoenix Lander.

      "\n",
      "<p>Using the orbiter's Mars Color Imager, Bruce Cantor of Malin Space Science Systems, San Diego, began observing the storm on Nov. 10, and subsequently reported it to the team operating NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity. The storm came no closer than about 837 miles (1,347 kilometers) from Opportunity, resulting in only a slight drop in atmospheric clarity over that rover, which does not have a weather station.</p>\n",

      "<p>Halfway around the planet from Opportunity, the NASA Mars rover Curiosity's weather station has detected atmospheric changes related to the storm.  Sensors on the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS), which was provided for Curiosity by Spain, have measured decreased air pressure and a slight rise in overnight low temperature.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"This is now a regional dust storm. It has covered a fairly extensive region with its dust haze, and it is in a part of the planet where some regional storms in the past have grown into global dust hazes,\" said Rich Zurek, chief Mars scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"For the first time since the Viking missions of the 1970s, we are studying a regional dust storm both from orbit and with a weather station on the surface.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity's equatorial location and the sensors on REMS, together with the daily global coverage provided by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, provide new advantages compared with what Viking offered with its combination of orbiters and landers. The latest weekly Mars weather report from the orbiter's Mars Color Imager is at <a href=\"http://www.msss.com/msss_images/2012/11/21/\">http://www.msss.com/msss_images/2012/11/21/</a> .</p>\n",

      "<p>Each Martian year lasts about two Earth years. Regional dust storms expanded and affected vast areas of Mars in 2001 and 2007, but not between those years nor since 2007.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"One thing we want to learn is why do some Martian dust storms get to this size and stop growing, while others this size keep growing and go global,\" Zurek said.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>From decades of observing Mars, scientists know there is a seasonal pattern to the largest Martian dust-storm events. The dust-storm season began just a few weeks ago, with the start of southern-hemisphere spring. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Starting on Nov. 16, the Mars Climate Sounder instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter detected a warming of the atmosphere at about 16 miles (25 kilometers) above the storm. Since then, the atmosphere in the region has warmed by about 45 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius). This is due to the dust absorbing sunlight at that height, so it indicates the dust is being lofted well above the surface and the winds are starting to create a dust haze over a broad region.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Warmer temperatures are seen not only in the dustier atmosphere in the south, but also in a hot spot near northern polar latitudes due to changes in the atmospheric circulation.  Similar changes affect the pressure measured by Curiosity even though the dust haze is still far away.  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Besides the research value in better understanding storm behavior, monitoring the storm is also important for Mars rover operations. If the storm were to go global, the Opportunity rover would be affected most. More dust in the air or falling onto its solar panels would reduce the solar-powered rover's energy supply for daily operations.  Curiosity is powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, rather than solar cells. The main effects of increased dust in the air at its site would be haze in images and increased air temperature.</p>\n",

However, east-west winds appear to predominate. The rim of Gale Crater may be a factor.</p>\n",

      "<p>\"With the crater rim slope to the north and Mount Sharp to the south, we may be seeing more of the wind blowing along the depression in between the two slopes, rather than up and down the slope of Mount Sharp,\" said Claire Newman, a REMS investigator at Ashima Research in Pasadena. \"If we don't see a change in wind patterns as Curiosity heads up the slope of Mount Sharp -- that would be a surprise.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>Learning what happened to the Martian atmosphere will help scientists assess whether the planet ever was habitable. The present atmosphere of Mars is 100 times thinner than Earth's. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A set of instruments aboard the rover has ingested and analyzed samples of the atmosphere collected near the \"Rocknest\" site in Gale Crater where the rover is stopped for research. Findings from the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instruments suggest that loss of a fraction of the atmosphere, resulting from a physical process favoring retention of heavier isotopes of certain elements, has been a significant factor in the evolution of the planet. Isotopes are variants of the same element with different atomic weights. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Initial SAM results show an increase of five percent in heavier isotopes of carbon in the atmospheric carbon dioxide compared to estimates of the isotopic ratios present when Mars formed. These enriched ratios of heavier isotopes to lighter ones suggest the top of the atmosphere may have been lost to interplanetary space. Losses at the top of the atmosphere would deplete lighter isotopes. Isotopes of argon also show enrichment of the heavy isotope, matching previous estimates of atmosphere composition derived from studies of Martian meteorites on Earth. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Scientists theorize that in Mars' distant past its environment may have been quite different, with persistent water and a thicker atmosphere. NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution, or MAVEN, mission will investigate possible losses from the upper atmosphere when it arrives at Mars in 2014.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>With these initial sniffs of Martian atmosphere, SAM also made the most sensitive measurements ever to search for methane gas on Mars. Preliminary results reveal little to no methane. Methane is of interest as a simple precursor chemical for life. On Earth, it can be produced by either biological or non-biological processes. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Methane has been difficult to detect from Earth or the current generation of Mars orbiters because the gas exists on Mars only in traces, if at all. The Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS) in SAM provides the first search conducted within the Martian atmosphere for this molecule. The initial SAM measurements place an upper limit of just a few parts methane per billion parts of Martian atmosphere, by volume, with enough uncertainty that the amount could be zero. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Methane is clearly not an abundant gas at the Gale Crater site, if it is there at all. At this point in the mission we're just excited to be searching for it,\" said SAM TLS lead Chris Webster of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"While we determine upper limits on low values, atmospheric variability in the Martian atmosphere could yet hold surprises for us.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In Curiosity's first three months on Mars, SAM has analyzed atmosphere samples with two laboratory methods. One is a mass spectrometer investigating the full range of atmospheric gases. The other, TLS, has focused on carbon dioxide and methane. During its two-year prime mission, the rover also will use an instrument called a gas chromatograph that separates and identifies gases. The instrument also will analyze samples of soil and rock, as well as more atmosphere samples.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"With these first atmospheric measurements we already can see the power of having a complex chemical laboratory like SAM on the surface of Mars,\" said SAM Principal Investigator Paul Mahaffy of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. \"Both atmospheric and solid sample analyses are crucial for understanding Mars' habitability.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",

Analyzing water-bearing minerals and searching for and analyzing carbonates are high priorities for upcoming SAM solid sample analyses.</p>\n",

      "</div>PASADENA, Calif. -- NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter, already the longest-working spacecraft ever sent to Mars, will switch to some fresh, redundant equipment next week that has not been used since before launch in 2001.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Like many spacecraft, this orbiter carries a pair of redundant main computers, so that a backup is available if one fails.  Odyssey's \"A-side\" computer and \"B-side\" computer each have several other redundant subsystems linked to just that computer. The Odyssey team has decided to switch to the B-side computer to begin using the B-side's inertial measurement unit. This gyroscope-containing mechanism senses changes in the spacecraft's orientation, providing important information for control of pointing the antenna, solar arrays and instruments.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We have been on the A side for more than 11 years. Everything on the A side still works, but the inertial measurement unit on that side has been showing signs of wearing out,\" said Odyssey Mission Manager Chris Potts at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.  \"We will swap to the B side on Nov. 5 so that we still have some life available in reserve on the A side.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In many potential problem situations, the Odyssey's autonomous fault-protection response would switch the spacecraft from the active side to the other side. By preserving the capability of switching back to a fully functional A side, the mission continues to have the available protection of switching sides temporarily and correcting any fixable anomaly on the B side.  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The spare inertial measurement unit is factory new, last operated on the day before launch,\" Potts said. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Odyssey launched April 7, 2001, began orbiting Mars on Oct. 24 of that year, began systematic science observations of Mars in early 2002, and broke the previous record for longest-working Mars spacecraft in December 2010.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The side swap on Nov. 5 will intentionally put Odyssey into a reduced-activity status called \"safe mode.\" As the team and the spacecraft verify all systems can operate well over the following several days, the orbiter will return to full operations, conducting its own science observations, as well as serving as a communications relay for NASA's active Mars rovers Opportunity and Curiosity.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which shares the data relay return responsibility for the rovers at Mars, will carry the full burden of relay support for both rovers -- Opportunity and Curiosity -- during Odyssey's side-swap period.  There will be a reduction in the total amount of relay data returned from Mars. The rover teams will reduce the amount of data planned for downlinking until Odyssey returns to full capacity after the side swap is complete, and will maintain near-normal tactical operations in the interim.</p>\n",

      "<p>The minerals were identified in the first sample of Martian soil ingested recently by the rover.

      "\n",
      "<p>\"We had many previous inferences and discussions about the mineralogy of Martian soil,\" said David Blake of NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., who is the principal investigator for CheMin. \"Our quantitative results provide refined and in some cases new identifications of the minerals in this first X-ray diffraction analysis on Mars.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The identification of minerals in rocks and soil is crucial for the mission's goal to assess past environmental conditions. Each mineral records the conditions under which it formed. The chemical composition of a rock provides only ambiguous mineralogical information, as in the textbook example of the minerals diamond and graphite, which have the same chemical composition, but strikingly different structures and properties.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>CheMin uses X-ray diffraction, the standard practice for geologists on Earth using much larger laboratory instruments. This method provides more accurate identifications of minerals than any method previously used on Mars. X-ray diffraction reads minerals' internal structure by recording how their crystals distinctively interact with X-rays. Innovations from Ames led to an X-ray diffraction instrument compact enough to fit inside the rover. </p>\n",

The sample was processed through a sieve to exclude particles larger than 0.006 inch (150 micrometers), roughly the width of a human hair. The sample has at least two components: dust distributed globally in dust storms and fine sand originating more locally. Unlike conglomerate rocks Curiosity investigated a few weeks ago, which are several billion years old and indicative of flowing water, the soil material CheMin has analyzed is more representative of modern processes on Mars.</p>\n",

      "<p>The rover team used two instruments on Curiosity to study the chemical makeup of the football-size rock called \"Jake Matijevic\" (matt-EE-oh-vick) The results support some surprising recent measurements and provide an example of why identifying rocks' composition is such a major emphasis of the mission. Rock compositions tell stories about unseen environments and planetary processes.</p>\n",

      "<p>\"This rock is a close match in chemical composition to an unusual but well-known type of igneous rock found in many volcanic provinces on Earth,\" said Edward Stolper of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, who is a Curiosity co-investigator. \"With only one Martian rock of this type, it is difficult to know whether the same processes were involved, but it is a reasonable place to start thinking about its origin.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>Jake was the first rock analyzed by the rover's arm-mounted Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) instrument and about the thirtieth rock examined by the Chemistry and Camera (ChemCam) instrument. Two penny-size spots on Jake were analyzed Sept. 22 by the rover's improved and faster version of earlier APXS devices on all previous Mars rovers, which have examined hundreds of rocks. That information has provided scientists a library of comparisons for what Curiosity sees.</p>\n",
      "\n",

      "<p>ChemCam found unique compositions at each of 14 target points on the rock, hitting different mineral grains within it. </p>\n",

The rover's ability to put soil samples into analytical instruments is central to assessing whether its present location on Mars, called Gale Crater, ever offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life. Mineral analysis can reveal past environmental conditions. Chemical analysis can check for ingredients necessary for life.</p>\n",

      "<p>The rover's preparatory operations will involve testing its robotic scooping capabilities to collect and process soil samples. Later, it also will use a hammering drill to collect powdered samples from rocks. To begin preparations for a first scoop, the rover used one of its wheels Wednesday to scuff the soil to expose fresh material.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Next, the rover twice will scoop up some soil, shake it thoroughly inside the sample-processing chambers to scrub the internal surfaces, then discard the sample. Curiosity will scoop and shake a third measure of soil and place it in an observation tray for inspection by cameras mounted on the rover's mast. A portion of the third sample will be delivered to the mineral-identifying chemistry and mineralogy (CheMin) instrument inside the rover. From a fourth scoopful, samples will be delivered to both CheMin and to the sample analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument, which identifies chemical ingredients. </p>\n",

      "<p>\"We're going to take a close look at the particle size distribution in the soil here to be sure it's what we want,\" said Daniel Limonadi of JPL, lead systems engineer for Curiosity's surface sampling and science system. \"We are being very careful with this first time using the scoop on Mars.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>The \"blueberries\" found earlier are concretions formed by the action of mineral-laden water inside rocks, but that is only one of the ways nature can make small, rounded particles.

Others include that they may be accretionary lapilli formed in volcanic ash eruptions, impact spherules formed in impact events, or devitrification spherules resulting from formation of crystals from formerly melted material.

      "\n",
      "<p>Opportunity is investigating an outcrop called Kirkwood in the Cape York segment of the western rim of Endeavour Crater. The spheres measure as much as one-eighth of an inch (3 millimeters) in diameter. The analysis is still preliminary, but it indicates that these spheres do not have the high iron content of Martian blueberries.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"This is one of the most extraordinary pictures from the whole mission,\" said Opportunity's principal investigator, Steve Squyres of Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. \"Kirkwood is chock full of a dense accumulation of these small spherical objects. Of course, we immediately thought of the blueberries, but this is something different. We never have seen such a dense accumulation of spherules in a rock outcrop on Mars.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Martian blueberries found elsewhere by Opportunity are concretions formed by action of mineral-laden water inside rocks, evidence of a wet environment on early Mars. Concretions result when minerals precipitate out of water to become hard masses inside sedimentary rocks. Many of the Kirkwood spheres are broken and eroded by the wind. Where wind has partially etched them away, a concentric structure is evident.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Opportunity used the microscopic imager on its arm to look closely at Kirkwood. Researchers checked the spheres' composition by using an instrument called the Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer on Opportunity's arm. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"They seem to be crunchy on the outside, and softer in the middle,\" Squyres said. \"They are different in concentration. They are different in structure. They are different in composition. They are different in distribution. So, we have a wonderful geological puzzle in front of us. We have multiple working hypotheses, and we have no favorite hypothesis at this time. It's going to take a while to work this out, so the thing to do now is keep an open mind and let the rocks do the talking.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Just past Kirkwood lies another science target area for Opportunity. The location is an extensive pale-toned outcrop in an area of Cape York where observations from orbit have detected signs of clay minerals. That may be the rover's next study site after Kirkwood. Four years ago, Opportunity departed Victoria Crater, which it had investigated for two years, to reach different types of geological evidence at the rim of the much larger Endeavour Crater. </p>\n",

      "<p>MAHLI is also aiding evaluation of the arm's ability to position its tools and instruments. Curiosity moved the arm to predetermined \"teach points\" on Sept. 11, including points above each of three inlet ports where it will later drop samples of soil and powdered rock into analytical instruments inside the rover. Images from the MAHLI camera confirmed the placements. Photos taken before and after opening the inlet cover for the chemistry and mineralogy (CheMin) analytical instrument also confirmed good operation of the cover.</p>\n",

      "<br />PASADENA, Calif. -- NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter data have given scientists the clearest evidence yet of carbon-dioxide snowfalls on Mars. This reveals the only known example of carbon-dioxide snow falling anywhere in our solar system.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Frozen carbon dioxide, better known as \"dry ice,\" requires temperatures of about minus 193 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 125 Celsius), which is much colder than needed for freezing water. Carbon-dioxide snow reminds scientists that although some parts of Mars may look quite Earth-like, the Red Planet is very different. The report is being published in the Journal of Geophysical Research.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"These are the first definitive detections of carbon-dioxide snow clouds,\" said the report's lead author, Paul Hayne of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"We firmly establish the clouds are composed of carbon dioxide -- flakes of Martian air -- and they are thick enough to result in snowfall accumulation at the surface.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The snowfalls occurred from clouds around the Red Planet's south pole in winter. The presence of carbon-dioxide ice in Mars' seasonal and residual southern polar caps has been known for decades. Also, NASA's Phoenix Lander mission in 2008 observed falling water-ice snow on northern Mars. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Hayne and six co-authors analyzed data gained by looking at clouds straight overhead and sideways with the Mars Climate Sounder, one of six instruments on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. This instrument records brightness in nine wavebands of visible and infrared light as a way to examine particles and gases in the Martian atmosphere. The analysis was conducted while Hayne was a post-doctoral fellow at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The data provide information about temperatures, particle sizes and their concentrations. The new analysis is based on data from observations in the south polar region during southern Mars winter in 2006-2007, identifying a tall carbon-dioxide cloud about 300 miles (500 kilometers) in diameter persisting over the pole and smaller, shorter-lived, lower-altitude carbon dioxide ice clouds at latitudes from 70 to 80 degrees south.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"One line of evidence for snow is that the carbon-dioxide ice particles in the clouds are large enough to fall to the ground during the lifespan of the clouds,\" co-author David Kass of JPL said. \"Another comes from observations when the instrument is pointed toward the horizon, instead of down at the surface. The infrared spectra signature of the clouds viewed from this angle is clearly carbon-dioxide ice particles and they extend to the surface. By observing this way, the Mars Climate Sounder is able to distinguish the particles in the atmosphere from the dry ice on the surface.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Mars' south polar residual ice cap is the only place on the Red Planet where frozen carbon dioxide persists on the surface year-round. Just how the carbon dioxide from Mars' atmosphere gets deposited has been in question. It is unclear whether it occurs as snow or by freezing out at ground level as frost. These results show snowfall is especially vigorous on top of the residual cap.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The finding of snowfall could mean that the type of deposition -- snow or frost -- is somehow linked to the year-to-year preservation of the residual cap,\" Hayne said.</p>\n",

      "<br />PASADENA, Calif. - NASA's Mars rover Curiosity stepped through activities on Sept. 7, 8 and 9 designed to check and characterize precision movements by the rover's robotic arm and use of tools on the arm. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The activities confirmed good health and usefulness of Mars Hand Lens Imager, or MAHLI, and used that camera to check arm placement during several positioning activities.  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>MAHLI took an image with its reclosable dust cover open for the first time on Mars, confirming sharp imaging capability that had been obscured by a thin film of dust on the cover during previous use of the camera. It took images of cameras at the top of Curiosity's mast, of the underbelly of the rover and of MAHLI's own calibration target, among other pointings.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Wow, seeing these images after all the tremendous hard work that has gone into making them possible is a profoundly emotional moment,\" said MAHLI Principal Investigator Ken Edgett of Malin Space Science Systems, San Diego. \"It is so exciting to see the camera returning beautiful, sharp images from Mars.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>The camera's calibration target includes a 1909 Lincoln penny that Edgett purchased for this purpose. \"We're seeing the penny in the foreground and, looking past it, a setting I'm sure the people who minted these coins never imagined,\" Edgett said. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The penny is a nod to geologists' tradition of placing a coin or other object of known scale as a size reference in close-up photographs of rocks, and it gives the public a familiar object for perceiving size easily when it will be viewed by MAHLI on Mars.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The folks who drive the rover's arm and turret have taken a 220-pound arm through some very complex tai chi, to center a penny in an image that's only a few centimeters across,\" said MAHLI Deputy Principal Investigator Aileen Yingst of the Tucson-based Planetary Science Institute. \"They make the impossible look easy.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The arm characterization activities, including more imaging by MAHLI, will continue for a few days before Curiosity resumes driving toward a mid-term science destination area called Glenelg. In that area, the rover may use its scoop to collect a soil sample, and later its drill to collect a sample of powder from inside a rock. </p>\n",

Recent drives along the inner edge of the Cape York segment of the western rim of Endeavour Crater have brought the rover close to a layered outcrop in an area where clay minerals have been detected from orbit.

      "</div>NASA's Curiosity rover took its first test stroll Wednesday Aug. 22, 2012, and beamed back pictures of its accomplishment in the form of track marks in the Martian soil. Careful inspection of the tracks reveals a unique, repeating pattern, which the rover can use as a visual reference to drive more accurately in barren terrain. The pattern is Morse code for JPL, the abbreviation for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., where the rover was designed and built, and the mission is managed.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The purpose of the pattern is to create features in the terrain that can be used to visually measure the precise distance between drives,\" said Matt Heverly, the lead rover driver for Curiosity at JPL. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This driving tool, called visual odometry, allows the rover to use images of landscape features to determine if it has traveled as far as predicted, or if its wheels have slipped. For example, when the rover drives on high slopes or across loose soil, it will routinely stop to check its progress. By measuring its distance relative to dozens of prominent features like pebbles or shadows on rocks -- or patterns in its tracks -- the rover can check how much its wheels may have slipped. If Curiosity has not slipped too much, it can then re-plan the next leg of its drive, taking its actual position into account. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Visual odometry will enable Curiosity to drive more accurately even in high-slip terrains, aiding its science mission by reaching interesting targets in fewer sols, running slip checks to stop before getting too stuck, and enabling precise driving,\" said rover driver Mark Maimone, who led the development of the rover's autonomous driving software.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Morse code imprinted on all six wheels will be particularly handy when the terrain is barren. Curiosity won't be able to read the Morse code symbols in the track marks directly, but it will note that the pattern is a high-contrast feature. This will give the rover the anchor it needs in an otherwise featureless terrain.</p>\n",

If you had one picket that was a different shape though, you could always use that picket as your reference,\" said Heverly. \"With Curiosity, it's a similar problem in featureless terrain like sand dunes. The hole pattern in the wheels gives us one 'big picket' to look at.\"  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>NASA's Mars Exploration rovers Spirit and Opportunity also used visual odometry to ensure accurate driving in difficult terrains. Their wheels had been bolted to their landing platform, leaving holes that left distinguishing marks in their tracks. Those marks proved critical for the visual odometry system on Opportunity when it traversed the relatively featureless terrain at Meridian Planum. Opportunity is still trekking on Mars more than eight years after setting down on the Red Planet.</p>\n",

      "<p>Curiosity likewise has holes in its wheels, only in the shape of Morse code letters. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Even though Curiosity didn't need to be bolted down, we wanted to have the holes anyway. The mechanical team suggested multiple smaller holes rather than one large one like the Mars Exploration Rovers had, and one earlier design had spelled out letters in a cleat pattern, so I proposed using a Morse code version,\" said Maimone. \"And the rest is history.\"</p>\n",

When added together, the entry, descent and landing of NASA's Curiosity Mars rover had been touted as \"Seven Minutes of Terror,\" and as far as Sell was concerned things were trending in that direction. What the 42-year-old engineer from Gettysburg, Pa., wanted more than anything in that seventh minute was to hear the words \"UHF Strong.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>There had been a debate amongst Curiosity's entry, descent and landing team about what their first words to indicate that the rover had reached the surface should be. The EDL team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory knew their microphones would be \"hot\" and that NASA TV was beaming the landing event out live to anybody with the desire and wherewithal to watch. They also knew that landing safely on Mars meant more than simply landing on Mars - which any one of the 34 engineers present at JPL's Building 264 Room 230, also known as the \"EDL War Room,\" will tell you at great length is not simple at all. Their rocket-propelled backpack and rover-lowering Sky Crane system were getting their first all-up test 154 million miles (248 million kilometers) away from home, and there was still plenty that could go wrong even after the rover was gently placed on the surface... plenty.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>What if the descent stage kept descending right on top of the rover? What if the bridles connecting the two did not separate? What if the algorithm used to throttle up the engines for the flyaway maneuver was not accurate?</p>\n",

      "<p>It was the remaining \"what ifs\" that made what those first words from Mars confirming the rover was on the surface so important.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"If we said 'touchdown,' then people not intimately familiar with EDL might infer that Curiosity was good to go,\" said Sell. \"But two more major calls had to be made before I could begin to breathe again.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>At 10:31:45 p.m. PDT, Jody Davis saw the event record, or EVR, she was looking for appear on her computer screen in the EDL War Room. She knew that the \"Touchdown\" EVR would only be beamed down if the rover's descent stage had throttled down -- a result which could only occur if the descent stage had offloaded half its weight. The only way the rover could offload half its weight in an instant is if it were being held up from below.</p>\n",

      "<p>\"RIMU stands for Rover Inertial Measurement Unit,\" said Sell. \"The RIMU gives us the rover's orientation as well as any movement it is making.

      "<p>Not receiving that one final call would be something of a long shot to be sure. After all, the rover was down on the ground, and RIMU indicated it wasn't moving. Their system had been proven every step of the way so far. But everyone in the EDL War Room got as far as they did not only because they were excellent engineers, but because of their predilection for concocting unappetizing entry, descent and landing scenarios - and then figuring out how to elude them.  And one ton of fuel-laden, rocket-firing descent stage climbing straight up, only to fall right back down on their factory-fresh landing site and an otherwise good-to-go, roving Mars laboratory was about as unappetizing a scenario as Sell could imagine. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>That final confirmation would not come from Sell's location. The final confirmation that Curiosity had landed clean would come 200 yards and one building away from the EDL War Room. There, in the Mission Support Area of JPL's Building 230, Adam Steltzner, the mission's EDL phase lead, was staring across the room at Brian Schwartz, who was not making eye contact with anyone. Schwartz, the EDL communications engineer, was staring at his screen. His task was not to check for a good-news EVR from the rover. Instead, he was waiting to see if the UHF signal became intermittent, faded away or just cut out altogether - all potential indications that the rover and descent stage had not gone their separate ways. </p>\n",

      "<p>Months, and even years before landing, Steltzner and his team had kicked around the idea of imaging the final moments of the descent stage's short life. Wouldn't it be cool if the rover's first pic could be timed just so?</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Working with the surface operations team, they got the timing of the first images from the surface timed for about 40 seconds after landing - a little bit after the time the descent stage was estimated to impact the ground after flying away to a safe distance.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We thought the odds were pretty small that we would see it,\" said Steltzner. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>But there, right in the upper-middle of those first rear-hazcam images, was a plume of dust rising from the surface. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A later image, taken by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera, or HiRISE, aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft in Martian orbit, provides the location of what Curiosity team members believe is the final destination of the powered descent stage - or Sky Crane - which was programmed to fly away automatically after safely depositing the rover on the surface. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"With HiRISE we get the Sky Crane's distance and its compass heading with respect to the rover,\" said Steltzner. \"The cloud seen in the distance on the Hazcam images is in perfect alignment with where we would expect to see the descent stage. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The inescapable conclusion is that we captured the result of what happens when about 2,200 pounds (1,000 kilograms) of Sky Crane intersect with Martian surface at a pretty good clip. It is truly an amazing shot on a day full of amazing shots.\" </p>\n",

      "<p>\"We are certainly excited, but our veterans on this team know the drill,\" said Tom Hoffman, project manager for InSight from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"Which is fortunate, because one of the great things we'll get to do on Mars is drill below the surface.\" \r\n",
      "<br /> \r\n",
      "<br />Drilling underneath the red Martian topsoil will be courtesy of InSight's HP3, or Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package – one of the four instruments the Mars lander will carry. Made by the German Aerospace Center, or DLR, HP3 will get below Mars' skin by literally pounding it into submission with a 14-inch (35-centimeter), hollowed-out, electromechanically-festooned stake called the Tractor Mole.\r\n",
      "<br /> \r\n",
      "<br />\"The Tractor Mole has an internal hammer that rises and falls, moving the stake down in the soil and dragging a tether along behind it,\" said Sue Smrekar, deputy project scientist for InSight from JPL. \"We're essentially doing the same thing any Boy or Girl Scout would do on a campout, but we're putting our stake down on Mars.\" \r\n",
      "<br /> \r\n",
      "<br />The German-built mole will descend up to 16 feet (five meters) below the surface, where its temperature sensors will record how much heat is coming from Mars' interior, which reveals the planet's thermal history.\r\n",
      "<br /> \r\n",
      "<br />\"Getting well below the surface gets us away from the sun's influence and allows us to measure heat coming from the interior,\" said Smrekar. \"InSight is going take heartbeat and vital signs of the Red Planet for an entire Martian year, two Earth years. We are really going to have an opportunity to understand the processes that control the early planetary formation.\"\r\n",
      "<br /> \r\n",
      "<br />InSight stands for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport. The mission is led by W. Bruce Banerdt of JPL. InSight's science team includes U.S. and international co-investigators from universities, industry and government agencies.

      "</div>PASADENA, Calif. -- The scientists and engineers of NASA's Curiosity rover mission have selected the first driving destination for their one-ton, six-wheeled mobile Mars laboratory. The target area, named Glenelg, is a natural intersection of three kinds of terrain. The choice was described by Curiosity Project Scientist John Grotzinger of the California Institute of Technology during a media teleconference on Aug. 17.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"With such a great landing spot in Gale Crater, we literally had every degree of the compass to choose from for our first drive,\" Grotzinger said. \"We had a bunch of strong contenders. It is the kind of dilemma planetary scientists dream of, but you can only go one place for the first drilling for a rock sample on Mars. That first drilling will be a huge moment in the history of Mars exploration.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The trek to Glenelg will send the rover 1,300 feet (400 meters) east-southeast of its landing site. One of the three types of terrain intersecting at Glenelg is layered bedrock, which is attractive as the first drilling target.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We're about ready to load our new destination into our GPS and head out onto the open road,\" Grotzinger said. \"Our challenge is there is no GPS on Mars, so we have a roomful of rover-driver engineers providing our turn-by-turn navigation for us.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Prior to the rover's trip to Glenelg, the team in charge of Curiosity's Chemistry and Camera instrument, or ChemCam, is planning to give their mast-mounted, rock-zapping laser and telescope combination a thorough checkout. On Saturday night, Aug. 18, ChemCam is expected to \"zap\" its first rock in the name of planetary science. It will be the first time such a powerful laser has been used on the surface of another world.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Rock N165 looks like your typical Mars rock, about three inches wide. It's about 10 feet away,\" said Roger Wiens, principal investigator of the ChemCam instrument from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. \"We are going to hit it with 14 millijoules of energy 30 times in 10 seconds. It is not only going to be an excellent test of our system, it should be pretty cool too.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Mission engineers are devoting more time to planning the first roll of Curiosity. In the coming days, the rover will exercise each of its four steerable (front and back) wheels, turning each of them side-to-side before ending up with each wheel pointing straight ahead. On a later day, the rover will drive forward about one rover-length (10 feet, or 3 meters), turn 90 degrees, and then kick into reverse for about 7 feet (2 meters).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"There will be a lot of important firsts that will be taking place for Curiosity over the next few weeks, but the first motion of its wheels, the first time our roving laboratory on Mars does some actual roving, that will be something special,\" said Michael Watkins, mission manager for Curiosity from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft delivered Curiosity to its target area on Mars at 10:31:45 p.m. PDT on Aug. 5 (1:31:45 a.m. EDT on Aug. 6), which included the 13.8 minutes needed for confirmation of the touchdown to be radioed to Earth at the speed of light.</p>\n",

      "<p>\"The rover appears as double bright spot plus shadows from this perspective, looking at its shadowed side, set in the middle of the blast pattern from the descent stage,\" said HiRISE Principal Investigator Alfred McEwen, of the University of Arizona, Tucson. \"This image was acquired from an angle looking 30 degrees westward of straight down.  We plan to get one in a few days looking more directly down, showing the rover in more detail and completing a stereo pair.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Meanwhile, Curiosity has finished a four-day process transitioning both of its redundant main computers to flight software for driving and using tools on the rover's arm.  During the latter part of the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft's 36-week flight to Mars and its complicated descent to deliver Curiosity to the Martian surface on Aug. 5, PDT (Aug. 6, EDT and Universal Time), the rover's computers used a version of flight software with many capabilities no longer needed. The new version expands capabilities for work the rover will do now that it is on Mars.</p>\n",

      "<p>\"The science and operations teams are evaluating several potential routes that would take us to Mount Sharp, with perhaps a few waypoints to inspect some of the different terrains we've identified as we map the landing area,\" Vasavada said. \"As we have reported many times before, it's going to take us a good part of our first year to make it to the layered sediments on Mount Sharp.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>During a prime mission of nearly two years, researchers will use Curiosity to investigate whether the selected area of Mars has ever offered chemical ingredients for life and other environmental conditions favorable for supporting microbial life.

      "<br />NASA's Curiosity rover has shipped back to Earth high-resolution color images of its surroundings on Mars, sharpening our views of an intriguing channel, layered buttes and a layer of cobbles and pebbles embedded in a finer matrix of material. The images show a landscape closely resembling portions of the southwestern United States, adding to the impression gained from the lower-resolution thumbnail images released earlier this week.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The 79 images that went into the large mosaics were taken on Aug. 8, 2012 PDT (Aug. 9, EDT) by Curiosity's 34-millimeter Mastcam. The black areas indicate high-resolution images not yet returned by the rover. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The full-resolution images are available at: <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/msl\">http://www.nasa.gov/msl</a> and <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/images/\">http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/images/</a> . </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity sent lower-resolution versions of these images earlier in the week. The latest versions, sent while Curiosity was undergoing a software \"brain transplant\" and pausing in its acquisition of new science data, are 1,200 by 1,200 pixels.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In one version of the large mosaic, the colors portrayed are unmodified from those returned by the camera. The view is what a cell phone or camcorder would record, since the Mastcam takes color pictures in the exact same manner that consumer cameras acquire color images. The second version shows the colors modified as if the scene were transported to Earth and illuminated by terrestrial sunlight. This processing, called \"white balancing,\" is useful for scientists to be able to recognize and distinguish rocks by their color in more familiar lighting.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Smaller mosaics of some of the areas most interesting to science team members are also available. One shows a section on the crater wall north of the landing site, where a network of valleys believed to have formed by water erosion enters Gale Crater from the outside. This is the first view scientists have had of a fluvial system - one relating to a river or stream - from the surface of Mars. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A second section of the mosaic looks south of the landing site, towards Mount Sharp, a peak that is about 3.4 miles (5.5 kilometers) high and taller than Mt. Whitney in California. This provides an overview of the eventual geologic targets Curiosity will explore in the next two years. Close by is a rock-strewn, gravelly surface. Farther away is a dark dune field, and beyond that lie the layered buttes and mesas of the sedimentary rock of Mount Sharp.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Another section of the mosaic shows an area excavated by the blast of the Mars Science Laboratory's descent stage rockets. With the loose debris blasted away by the rockets, details of the underlying materials are clearly seen. Of particular note is a well-defined, topmost layer that contains fragments of rock embedded in a matrix of finer material. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity continues to be very healthy, with all instruments and engineering subsystems operating as planned. There are no science or instrument activities planned on Sol 5. Last night, the new flight software, which is optimized for surface operations, was tested for the first time and successfully executed all planned Sol 5 rover activities. The test demonstrated that the new software is ready to support the upcoming surface operations mission phase. After an afternoon nap, Curiosity then returned to operating on its previous flight software, as planned. The rover's primary main computer will be permanently transitioned to the new flight software on Aug. 13. </p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>A healthy Curiosity spent Sol 4, its fifth day on Mars, preparing for this weekend's planned \"brain transplant\"--transitioning to a new version of flight software on both of Curiosity's redundant main computers. The new software is better suited for Mars surface operations, such as driving and using Curiosity's robotic arm. The \"brain transplant\" will take place during a series of steps beginning this evening and continuing through Aug. 13. The new software was uploaded to the rover's memory during the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft's flight from Earth. Key capabilities in the new software enable full use of Curiosity's powerful robotic arm and drill, and advanced image processing to check for obstacles while driving. This will ultimately allow Curiosity to make longer drives by giving the rover more autonomy to identify and avoid potential hazards and to drive along a safe path that the rover identifies for itself.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />The flight team elected to defer further science activities until after the flight software transition is completed. Several Mastcam color images were downlinked. The mission's science team is busy analyzing images Curiosity has taken of its surroundings, and is discussing features of interest that they will investigate in a few weeks once initial checkouts of the rover and the landing site are completed.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><h3>August 9: Curiosity Reveals its First 'Living Color' Mars Surface Panorama</h3></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity awoke from her \"beauty sleep\" today to the toe-tapping tune \"Good Morning\" from the musical \"Singing in the Rain,\" feeling healthy and refreshed and ready for a busy day of continued health checks and imagery. The rover continues to perform very well. Today's Sol 3 morning and afternoon passes by NASA's Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft provided a plethora of new data, including more high-resolution black-and-white 360-degree and deck panorama images from her Navigation Camera, or Navcam, which revealed some small pebbles deposited on the deck during landing, which should pose no problems for mission operations. Curiosity also returned 130 low-resolution thumbnail images from the color Mast Camera, or Mastcam, providing scientists and engineers with their first color panorama glimpse of Gale Crater.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />Curiosity's day began with a \"beep\" from its low-gain antenna, telling the flight team that their master sequence of activities for that sol was successfully activated from the ground. The flight team then uploaded files to the rover's remote electronics unit memory in preparation for the upcoming Sol 5 upgrade of Curiosity's software to optimize Curiosity for surface operations. Curiosity's backup computer was then powered on and successfully checked out. The Radiation Assessment Detector instrument is operating as planned and collected additional data on surface radiation. The Mastcam is operating as planned and successfully executed its 360-degree and calibration target observations. In addition, early checkouts of the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS), Chemistry & Mineralogy Analyzer (CheMin), Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM), and Dynamic Albedo Neutrons (DAN) instruments were all successful.  The mission's science team began creating a geological map of about 150 square miles (about 390 square kilometers) within Gale Crater, including the landing area.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />Curiosity is \"go\" for its planned Sol 4 activities.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><h3>August 8: Curiosity Continues Checking Herself Out; Takes Self Portrait</h3></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>After waking up to the rousing refrains of the Beatles' \"Good Morning Good Morning,\" a healthy Curiosity continued checking out her systems and returning amazing imagery. The Sol 2 morning and afternoon UHF communications passes from NASA's Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft provided significant new data, including spectacular full-frame images of the Mars Science Laboratory's descent through the Martian atmosphere by Curiosity's Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) instrument. Other imagery included full-frame views from the rover's navigation cameras, or Navcams, looking at the rim of Gale Crater; the first, lower-resolution thumbnail 360-degree view of Curiosity's new surroundings in Gale Crater; deck pan images of the rover herself; and images of the Martian surface next to the rover. Another image set, courtesy of the Context Camera, or CTX, aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, has pinpointed the final resting spots of the six, 55-pound (25-kilogram) entry ballast masses. These tungsten masses impacted the Martian surface at high speed, about 7.5 miles (12 kilometers) from Curiosity's landing location.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />The rover's high-gain antenna was successfully pointed toward Earth. Its 3.6-foot-tall (1.1-meter) remote sensing mast was deployed, and range of motion was successfully tested. Surface radiation data were acquired from the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument but have not yet been downlinked.  Curiosity's temperatures are running a bit warmer than expected; however, the flight team believes this is because Gale Crater is simply a bit warmer than originally predicted. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Plans for Sol 3 include assessing the performance of the high-gain antenna; uplinking files for the upcoming transition of Curiosity's flight software to the surface-optimized version R10 on Sol 5; Radiation Assessment Detector instrument observations; and Mastcam calibration target and 360-degree color panorama images. In addition, the rover's Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS), Chemistry & Mineralogy Analyzer (CheMin), Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM), and Dynamic Albedo Neutrons (DAN) instruments will be checked out.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><h3>August 7: Curiosity Gets More Looks at its Surroundings; Health Checks Continue</h3></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity is healthy as it continues to familiarize itself with its new home in Gale Crater and check out its systems. The team's plans for Curiosity checkout today included raising the rover's mast and continued testing of its high-gain antenna, whose pointing toward Earth will be adjusted on Sol 2. Science data were collected from Curiosity's Radiation Assessment Detector, and activities were performed with the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station instrument. Curiosity transmitted its first color image from the surface of Mars, from the Mars Hand Lens Imager, or MAHLI, showing part of the north rim of Gale Crater. Additional calibration images were received from Curiosity's Navcam and Mastcam. All systems are go for deployment of the rover's remote sensing mast on Sol 2, followed by a 360-degree pan by the rover's Navcam. The Mastcam will also be calibrated against a target image on the rover. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter returned a spectacular image of Curiosity's landing site, depicting the rover, parachute, back shell, heat shield and descent stage. Data were received from both NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><h3>Aug. 6: Curiosity Safely on Mars! Health Checks Begin </h3>\n",
      "<br />With Curiosity now safely on the surface of the Red Planet after last night's spectacular entry, descent and landing in Gale Crater, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory begins its planned primary one-Martian-year (98-week) mission of discovery and exploration. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>On its first Martian day, designated Sol 0, the rover is checking its health and measuring its tilt. All Sol 0 spacecraft activities appear to have been completely nominal. These include firing all of Curiosity's pyrotechnic devices for releasing post-landing deployments. Spring-loaded deployments, such as removal of dust covers from the Hazard-Avoidance cameras (Hazcams) occur immediately when pyros are fired. Curiosity also took images with its front and rear Hazcams both before and after removal of the dust covers, checked out its UHF telecommunications system and rover motor controller assembly, and completed all activities required to proceed with its planned activities on Sol 1. Approximately five megabytes of data were successfully relayed back to Earth from NASA's Mars Odyssey spacecraft during its overpass today.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity landed facing east-southeast within Gale Crater, with a heading of 112.7 degrees (plus or minus five degrees), and a few degrees of tilt. A Sol 1 overpass by Mars Odyssey will provide additional information on Curiosity's position and additional imagery. A first look at some color images taken just before landing by MSL's Mars Descent Imager also provided additonal information on the rover's precise location.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Activities planned for Sol 1 during the mission's approximately one-month characterization activity phase include deploying Curiosity's high-gain antenna, collecting science data from Curiosity's Radiation Assessment Detector and Rover Environmental Monitoring Station instruments, and obtaining additional imagery. The mission's characterization activity phase is design to learn how all Curiosity's subsystems and instruments are functioning after landing and within the environment and gravitational field of Mars.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><h3>Aug. 5: Curiosity Set for Mars Landing Tonight</h3>\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />Its approximately 352 million mile (567 million kilometer), 36-week journey from Earth nearly complete, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft and its Curiosity rover are \"all systems go\" for touchdown in Mars' Gale Crater tonight at 10:31 p.m. PDT (1:31 a.m. EDT Aug. 6). This morning, flight controllers decided to forgo the sixth and final opportunity on the mission calendar for a course-correction maneuver. The spacecraft is headed for its target entry point at the top of Mars' atmosphere precisely enough that the maneuver was deemed unnecessary. In addition, this afternoon, mission controllers determined that no further updates are necessary to the onboard information the spacecraft will use during its autonomous control of MSL's entry, descent and landing. Parameters on a motion tracker were adjusted Saturday for fine-tuning determination of the spacecraft's orientation during its descent.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>As of 6:18 p.m. PDT (9:18 p.m. EDT), MSL was approximately 36,000 miles (57,936 kilometers) from Mars, traveling at a speed of about 8,400 mph (about 3,755 meters per second).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><h3>Aug. 4: Curiosity Closes in on its New 'Home'</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With Mars looming ever larger in front of it, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft and its Curiosity rover are in the final stages of preparing for entry, descent and landing on the Red Planet at 10:31 p.m. PDT Aug. 5 (1:31 a.m. EDT Aug. 6). Curiosity remains in good health with all systems operating as expected.  Today, the flight team uplinked and confirmed commands to make minor corrections to the spacecraft's navigation reference point parameters.  This afternoon, as part of the onboard sequence of autonomous activities leading to the landing, catalyst bed heaters are being turned on to prepare the eight Mars Lander Engines that are part of MSL's descent propulsion system. As of 2:25 p.m. PDT (5:25 p.m. EDT), MSL was approximately 261,000 miles (420,039 kilometers) from Mars, closing in at a little more than 8,000 mph (about 3,600 meters per second).<br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>Aug. 3: MSL Right on Course - TCM-5 Cancelled</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With less than three days to go before touchdown on the Red Planet, Curiosity remains in good health, with all systems operating as expected. Given the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft's consistent and stable course, today the project decided that the planned Trajectory Correction Maneuver 5 (TCM-5) and its corresponding update to parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during entry, descent and landing will not be necessary. As of 12:35 p.m. today PDT (3:35 p.m. EDT), the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft was approximately 468,000 miles (753,200 kilometers) from Mars, or a little less than twice the distance from Earth to the moon.  It is traveling at about 8,000 mph (3,576 meters per second). It will gradually increase in speed to about 13,200 mph (5,900 meters per second) by the time it reaches the top of the Martian atmosphere. \n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>Aug. 2:  MSL Remains on Track for Weekend Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Curiosity remains in good health, with no significant issues currently in work. There are no real-time activities planned today. The Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft remains on a consistent and stable course, well within the limits required to reach its target landing ellipse. As a result, yesterday the flight team decided to cancel the build and test of a contingency version of Trajectory Correction Maneuver 5. This contingency manuever, had it been needed, would have been used in the event an emergency prevented the team from executing the nominal scheduled TCM-5 maneuver, which is planned for Friday, Aug. 3, if needed. The project also canceled a corresponding update to parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during entry, descent and landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>Aug. 1: Further Preps for Entry, Descent and Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With Curiosity now flying under the control of the autonomous entry, descent and landing timeline, the Mars Science Laboratory team continues to monitor the spacecraft's health and trajectory. There are no real-time activities planned today. In the event that a fifth trajectory correction maneuver is needed to further fine-tune the spacecraft's course to reach its target landing ellipse, the flight team is making preparations for it. If needed, that maneuver would be executed on Friday, Aug. 3. Curiosity remains in good health, with no significant issues currently in work.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 31:  Entry, Descent and Landing Timeline Activated</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The Mars Science Laboratory continues its final preparations for entry, descent and landing this upcoming weekend. Yesterday, the flight team completed and confirmed a memory test on the software for the mechanical assembly that controls MSL's descent motor. They also configured the spacecraft for its transition to entry, descent and landing approach mode, and they enabled the spacecraft's hardware pyrotechnic devices. MSL is now under the control of the autonomous entry, descent and landing timeline flight software. The flight team continues to monitor Curiosity's onboard systems and flight trajectory.  The spacecraft and ground systems remain in good health, with no significant issues currently being worked.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 30:  Entry, Descent and Landing Procedure Begins</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory flight team begins executing its procedure for entry, descent and landing (EDL), and the spacecraft begins its sequence of autonomous activities leading to the landing this coming weekend.  These activities include enabling needed components and setting final parameters. In addition, the schedule over the next several days includes opportunities to update parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during EDL.  If needed, these updates can fine-tune the spacecraft's autonomous controls for its descent through the atmosphere. Some parameters give the spacecraft's onboard computer knowledge about where the vehicle is relative to Mars. Others may be updated based on observations by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft of Mars' variable atmospheric conditions in this week before landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 29: Course Maneuver Successful; MSL Begins Final Approach</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Late Saturday night, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft successfully fine-tuned its course to better zero in on its target entry point into the Martian atmosphere on landing day. Two brief thruster firings totaling about six seconds altered the spacecraft's velocity slightly, by about one-fortieth of one mile per hour (one centimeter per second). This trajectory correction maneuver the fourth since MSL's launch adjusted the point at which Curiosity will enter the Martian atmosphere by about 13 miles (21 kilometers). On landing day, MSL can steer enough during its flight through the upper atmosphere to correct for a miss of the target entry point by a few miles and still land within its target ellipse. Mission engineers and managers rated the projected 13-mile miss big enough to warrant a correction maneuver. Telemetry and tracking data indicate the maneuver was successful. MSL will have two further opportunities for additional course corrections during the final 48 hours before landing, if needed.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 28: MSL Set to Begin Final Approach</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Tonight the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft is scheduled to perform a very small course adjustment, called Trajectory Correction Maneuver 4 (TCM-4).  Around 10 p.m. PDT (1 a.m. EDT), two brief thruster firings totaling about six seconds will adjust the spacecraft's trajectory to better hone in on Curiosity's target entry point into the Martian atmosphere. This course adjustment will be the fourth performed during MSL's journey between Earth and Mars. The maneuver will turn the spacecraft to its final attitude and mark the start of Curiosity's final approach to the Red Planet. \n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 27: MSL Telemetry Monitoring, Trajectory Tracking Continue</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The flight team continues to monitor the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft's telemetry and track its trajectory. There are no real-time spacecraft activities planned today. Late tomorrow night, the spacecraft is scheduled to perform its fourth and smallest trajectory correction maneuver, which will mark the beginning of MSL's final approach to Mars.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 26: MSL Configured for Final Approach; Flight Team Takes a Breath</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With completion of nearly all work to configure the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft for entry, descent and landing, most of the flight team is getting some well-deserved rest today in preparation for next week's final approach to Mars. There are no planned flight team spacecraft activities today. NASA's Deep Space Network continues to monitor spacecraft telemetry and track the spacecraft's trajectory.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 25: MSL's Terminal Descent Radar System Gets a Checkout</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory's terminal descent sensor is being checked out in preparation for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing. The sensor is a radar system that is mounted on MSL's descent stage. Following separation of MSL's heat shield at an altitude of approximately 5 miles (8 kilometers) and a velocity of approximately 280 mph (125 meters per second), the sensor begins collecting data on the spacecraft's velocity and altitude in preparation for landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 24: Curiosity's Batteries Get a Charge</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, Curiosity's two lithium ion rechargeable batteries are being recharged to 100 percent of capacity in preparation for entry, descent and landing. The batteries, which have been maintained at a 70-percent state of charge during the cruise to Mars, are being recharged using power from Mars Science Laboratory's cruise-stage solar array. The batteries enable Curiosity's power subsystem to meet peak power demands of rover activities when the demand temporarily exceeds the onboard multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG) steady output level. With a capacity of about 42 amp-hours each, the batteries are expected to go through multiple charge-discharge cycles per Martian day.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 23: Prepping MSL's Descent Stage Navigation System for Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Preparations continue for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations. Today, the two inertial measurement units (IMUs) in Mars Science Laboratory's descent stage are being configured, along with other guidance and control parameters for entry, descent and landing. The IMUs are electronic devices that will be used to maneuver the spacecraft's descent stage, measuring and reporting on its velocity, orientation and gravitational forces. The descent stage does its main work during the final few minutes before touchdown on Mars, providing rocket-powered deceleration and two bands of telecommunications for the final phase of MSL's arrival at Mars that includes lowering the Curiosity rover on a bridle and continuing descent until rover touchdown. In addition, more communications parameter updates for Curiosity's surface operations are being uploaded to Curiosity's main computers.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 22: Trajectory Tracking Continues</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Engineers at NASA's Deep Space Network continue to run differential ranging track passes to track Mars Science Laboratory's trajectory. These activities are designed to more closely track the spacecraft's trajectory and position as it draws nearer to the Red Planet and Mars' gravitational influence on the spacecraft increases.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 21: Getting a Better Bead on Trajectory</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, engineers at NASA's Deep Space Network are running two differential ranging track passes to track Mars Science Laboratory's trajectory. These activities are designed to more closely track the spacecraft's trajectory and position as it draws nearer to the Red Planet and Mars' gravitational influence on the spacecraft increases.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 20: Curiosity Completes Week of Onboard Computer Preps</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />As of yesterday evening, the week-long reboot and configuration activities on Curiosity's two redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements -- including the uplink of spacecraft configuration parameters for entry, descent and landing -- were completed, a day ahead of schedule. Today, backup software for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing is being configured onboard the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft. In case Curiosity's prime computer resets for any reason during the critical minutes of entry, descent and landing, this backup software is designed to enable Curiosity's backup computer to promptly take control and finish the landing with a bare-bones version of entry, descent and landing instructions.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 19: More Computer Preps for Curiosity</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With updated flight sequences and communications parameters for entry, descent and landing and surface operations now uploaded to one of Curiosity's two redundant main computers -- Rover Compute Element (RCE)-B -- today RCE-A is being swapped back to become Curiosity's prime computer, and RCE-B is returning to backup mode. Prime computer RCE-A will then receive its own set of updated flight sequences and communications parameters.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 18: Curiosity Continues Computer Preps, Gets 'Attitude Adjustment'</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Activities continue to prepare Curiosity's redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements, for arrival at Mars. Today, Curiosity's RCE-A computer, which was swapped with the backup computer yesterday, is being cold reset, or rebooted, while in online, or backup, mode. Work continues to upload updated flight sequences and communications parameters for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations to the spacecraft. In addition, mission controllers yesterday completed the 21st attitude control turn on the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft, a day early. This turn adjusts the spacecraft's orientation to keep its medium-gain antenna pointed toward Earth for communications. This was the second-to-last attitude control turn planned before landing day.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 17: Curiosity Swaps Computers, Gets Updated Arrival Data</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Activities continue through July 20 to prepare Curiosity's redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements, for arrival at Mars. Today, the computer that has been operating as Curiosity's prime computer is being swapped with the backup computer. On Wednesday July 18, that computer will be cold reset, or rebooted, while in online, or backup mode, following the same process used to cold reset the redundant computer on July 16. In addition, beginning today and continuing through July 20, updated flight sequences and communications parameters for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations will be uploaded to the spacecraft.\n",

      "</div>PASADENA, Calif. -- NASA's Mars rover Curiosity will spend its first weekend on Mars transitioning to software better suited for tasks ahead, such as driving and using its strong robotic arm.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The rover's \"brain transplant,\" which will occur during a series of steps Aug. 10 through Aug. 13, will install a new version of software on both of the rover's redundant main computers.  This software for Mars surface operations was uploaded to the rover's memory during the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft's flight from Earth. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We designed the mission from the start to be able to upgrade the software as needed for different phases of the mission,\" said Ben Cichy of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., chief software engineer for the Mars Science Laboratory mission. \"The flight software version Curiosity currently is using was really focused on landing the vehicle. It includes many capabilities we just don't need any more. It gives us basic capabilities for operating the rover on the surface, but we have planned all along to switch over after landing to a version of flight software that is really optimized for surface operations.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A key capability in the new version is image processing to check for obstacles. This allows for longer drives by giving the rover more autonomy to identify and avoid potential hazards and drive along a safe path the rover identifies for itself. Other new capabilities facilitate use of the tools at the end of the rover's robotic arm.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>While Curiosity is completing the software transition, the mission's science team is continuing to analyze images the rover has taken of its surroundings inside Gale Crater.  Researchers are discussing which features in the scene to investigate after a few weeks of initial checkouts and observations to assess equipment on the rover and characteristics of the landing site.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft delivered Curiosity to its target area on Mars at 10:31:45 p.m. PDT on Aug. 5 (1:31:45 a.m. EDT on Aug. 6), which includes the 13.8 minutes needed for confirmation of the touchdown to be radioed to Earth at the speed of light.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity carries 10 science instruments with a total mass 15 times as large as the science payloads on NASA's Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity. Some of the tools, such as a laser-firing instrument for checking rocks' elemental composition from a distance, are the first of their kind on Mars. Curiosity will use a drill and scoop, which are located at the end of its robotic arm, to gather soil and powdered samples of rock interiors, then sieve and parcel out these samples into the rover's analytical laboratory instruments.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>To handle this science toolkit, Curiosity is twice as long and five times as heavy as Spirit or Opportunity. The Gale Crater landing site at 4.59 degrees south, 137.44 degrees east, places the rover within driving distance of layers of the crater's interior mountain. Observations from orbit have identified clay and sulfate minerals in the lower layers, indicating a wet history.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity awoke from her \"beauty sleep\" today to the toe-tapping tune \"Good Morning\" from the musical \"Singing in the Rain,\" feeling healthy and refreshed and ready for a busy day of continued health checks and imagery. The rover continues to perform very well. Today's Sol 3 morning and afternoon passes by NASA's Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft provided a plethora of new data, including more high-resolution black-and-white 360-degree and deck panorama images from her Navigation Camera, or Navcam, which revealed some small pebbles deposited on the deck during landing, which should pose no problems for mission operations. Curiosity also returned 130 low-resolution thumbnail images from the color Mast Camera, or Mastcam, providing scientists and engineers with their first color panorama glimpse of Gale Crater.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />Curiosity's day began with a \"beep\" from its low-gain antenna, telling the flight team that their master sequence of activities for that sol was successfully activated from the ground. The flight team then uploaded files to the rover's remote electronics unit memory in preparation for the upcoming Sol 5 upgrade of Curiosity's software to optimize Curiosity for surface operations. Curiosity's backup computer was then powered on and successfully checked out. The Radiation Assessment Detector instrument is operating as planned and collected additional data on surface radiation. The Mastcam is operating as planned and successfully executed its 360-degree and calibration target observations. In addition, early checkouts of the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS), Chemistry & Mineralogy Analyzer (CheMin), Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM), and Dynamic Albedo Neutrons (DAN) instruments were all successful.  The mission's science team began creating a geological map of about 150 square miles (about 390 square kilometers) within Gale Crater, including the landing area.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />Curiosity is \"go\" for its planned Sol 4 activities.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><h3>August 8: Curiosity Continues Checking Herself Out; Takes Self Portrait</h3></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>After waking up to the rousing refrains of the Beatles' \"Good Morning Good Morning,\" a healthy Curiosity continued checking out her systems and returning amazing imagery. The Sol 2 morning and afternoon UHF communications passes from NASA's Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft provided significant new data, including spectacular full-frame images of the Mars Science Laboratory's descent through the Martian atmosphere by Curiosity's Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) instrument. Other imagery included full-frame views from the rover's navigation cameras, or Navcams, looking at the rim of Gale Crater; the first, lower-resolution thumbnail 360-degree view of Curiosity's new surroundings in Gale Crater; deck pan images of the rover herself; and images of the Martian surface next to the rover. Another image set, courtesy of the Context Camera, or CTX, aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, has pinpointed the final resting spots of the six, 55-pound (25-kilogram) entry ballast masses. These tungsten masses impacted the Martian surface at high speed, about 7.5 miles (12 kilometers) from Curiosity's landing location.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />The rover's high-gain antenna was successfully pointed toward Earth. Its 3.6-foot-tall (1.1-meter) remote sensing mast was deployed, and range of motion was successfully tested. Surface radiation data were acquired from the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument but have not yet been downlinked.  Curiosity's temperatures are running a bit warmer than expected; however, the flight team believes this is because Gale Crater is simply a bit warmer than originally predicted. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Plans for Sol 3 include assessing the performance of the high-gain antenna; uplinking files for the upcoming transition of Curiosity's flight software to the surface-optimized version R10 on Sol 5; Radiation Assessment Detector instrument observations; and Mastcam calibration target and 360-degree color panorama images. In addition, the rover's Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS), Chemistry & Mineralogy Analyzer (CheMin), Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM), and Dynamic Albedo Neutrons (DAN) instruments will be checked out.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><h3>August 7: Curiosity Gets More Looks at its Surroundings; Health Checks Continue</h3></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity is healthy as it continues to familiarize itself with its new home in Gale Crater and check out its systems. The team's plans for Curiosity checkout today included raising the rover's mast and continued testing of its high-gain antenna, whose pointing toward Earth will be adjusted on Sol 2. Science data were collected from Curiosity's Radiation Assessment Detector, and activities were performed with the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station instrument. Curiosity transmitted its first color image from the surface of Mars, from the Mars Hand Lens Imager, or MAHLI, showing part of the north rim of Gale Crater. Additional calibration images were received from Curiosity's Navcam and Mastcam. All systems are go for deployment of the rover's remote sensing mast on Sol 2, followed by a 360-degree pan by the rover's Navcam. The Mastcam will also be calibrated against a target image on the rover. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter returned a spectacular image of Curiosity's landing site, depicting the rover, parachute, back shell, heat shield and descent stage. Data were received from both NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><h3>Aug. 6: Curiosity Safely on Mars! Health Checks Begin </h3>\n",
      "<br />With Curiosity now safely on the surface of the Red Planet after last night's spectacular entry, descent and landing in Gale Crater, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory begins its planned primary one-Martian-year (98-week) mission of discovery and exploration. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>On its first Martian day, designated Sol 0, the rover is checking its health and measuring its tilt. All Sol 0 spacecraft activities appear to have been completely nominal. These include firing all of Curiosity's pyrotechnic devices for releasing post-landing deployments. Spring-loaded deployments, such as removal of dust covers from the Hazard-Avoidance cameras (Hazcams) occur immediately when pyros are fired. Curiosity also took images with its front and rear Hazcams both before and after removal of the dust covers, checked out its UHF telecommunications system and rover motor controller assembly, and completed all activities required to proceed with its planned activities on Sol 1. Approximately five megabytes of data were successfully relayed back to Earth from NASA's Mars Odyssey spacecraft during its overpass today.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity landed facing east-southeast within Gale Crater, with a heading of 112.7 degrees (plus or minus five degrees), and a few degrees of tilt. A Sol 1 overpass by Mars Odyssey will provide additional information on Curiosity's position and additional imagery. A first look at some color images taken just before landing by MSL's Mars Descent Imager also provided additonal information on the rover's precise location.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Activities planned for Sol 1 during the mission's approximately one-month characterization activity phase include deploying Curiosity's high-gain antenna, collecting science data from Curiosity's Radiation Assessment Detector and Rover Environmental Monitoring Station instruments, and obtaining additional imagery. The mission's characterization activity phase is design to learn how all Curiosity's subsystems and instruments are functioning after landing and within the environment and gravitational field of Mars.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><h3>Aug. 5: Curiosity Set for Mars Landing Tonight</h3>\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />Its approximately 352 million mile (567 million kilometer), 36-week journey from Earth nearly complete, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft and its Curiosity rover are \"all systems go\" for touchdown in Mars' Gale Crater tonight at 10:31 p.m. PDT (1:31 a.m. EDT Aug. 6). This morning, flight controllers decided to forgo the sixth and final opportunity on the mission calendar for a course-correction maneuver. The spacecraft is headed for its target entry point at the top of Mars' atmosphere precisely enough that the maneuver was deemed unnecessary. In addition, this afternoon, mission controllers determined that no further updates are necessary to the onboard information the spacecraft will use during its autonomous control of MSL's entry, descent and landing. Parameters on a motion tracker were adjusted Saturday for fine-tuning determination of the spacecraft's orientation during its descent.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>As of 6:18 p.m. PDT (9:18 p.m. EDT), MSL was approximately 36,000 miles (57,936 kilometers) from Mars, traveling at a speed of about 8,400 mph (about 3,755 meters per second).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><h3>Aug. 4: Curiosity Closes in on its New 'Home'</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With Mars looming ever larger in front of it, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft and its Curiosity rover are in the final stages of preparing for entry, descent and landing on the Red Planet at 10:31 p.m. PDT Aug. 5 (1:31 a.m. EDT Aug. 6). Curiosity remains in good health with all systems operating as expected.  Today, the flight team uplinked and confirmed commands to make minor corrections to the spacecraft's navigation reference point parameters.  This afternoon, as part of the onboard sequence of autonomous activities leading to the landing, catalyst bed heaters are being turned on to prepare the eight Mars Lander Engines that are part of MSL's descent propulsion system. As of 2:25 p.m. PDT (5:25 p.m. EDT), MSL was approximately 261,000 miles (420,039 kilometers) from Mars, closing in at a little more than 8,000 mph (about 3,600 meters per second).<br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>Aug. 3: MSL Right on Course - TCM-5 Cancelled</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With less than three days to go before touchdown on the Red Planet, Curiosity remains in good health, with all systems operating as expected. Given the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft's consistent and stable course, today the project decided that the planned Trajectory Correction Maneuver 5 (TCM-5) and its corresponding update to parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during entry, descent and landing will not be necessary. As of 12:35 p.m. today PDT (3:35 p.m. EDT), the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft was approximately 468,000 miles (753,200 kilometers) from Mars, or a little less than twice the distance from Earth to the moon.  It is traveling at about 8,000 mph (3,576 meters per second). It will gradually increase in speed to about 13,200 mph (5,900 meters per second) by the time it reaches the top of the Martian atmosphere. \n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>Aug. 2:  MSL Remains on Track for Weekend Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Curiosity remains in good health, with no significant issues currently in work. There are no real-time activities planned today. The Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft remains on a consistent and stable course, well within the limits required to reach its target landing ellipse. As a result, yesterday the flight team decided to cancel the build and test of a contingency version of Trajectory Correction Maneuver 5. This contingency manuever, had it been needed, would have been used in the event an emergency prevented the team from executing the nominal scheduled TCM-5 maneuver, which is planned for Friday, Aug. 3, if needed. The project also canceled a corresponding update to parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during entry, descent and landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>Aug. 1: Further Preps for Entry, Descent and Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With Curiosity now flying under the control of the autonomous entry, descent and landing timeline, the Mars Science Laboratory team continues to monitor the spacecraft's health and trajectory. There are no real-time activities planned today. In the event that a fifth trajectory correction maneuver is needed to further fine-tune the spacecraft's course to reach its target landing ellipse, the flight team is making preparations for it. If needed, that maneuver would be executed on Friday, Aug. 3. Curiosity remains in good health, with no significant issues currently in work.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 31:  Entry, Descent and Landing Timeline Activated</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The Mars Science Laboratory continues its final preparations for entry, descent and landing this upcoming weekend. Yesterday, the flight team completed and confirmed a memory test on the software for the mechanical assembly that controls MSL's descent motor. They also configured the spacecraft for its transition to entry, descent and landing approach mode, and they enabled the spacecraft's hardware pyrotechnic devices. MSL is now under the control of the autonomous entry, descent and landing timeline flight software. The flight team continues to monitor Curiosity's onboard systems and flight trajectory.  The spacecraft and ground systems remain in good health, with no significant issues currently being worked.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 30:  Entry, Descent and Landing Procedure Begins</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory flight team begins executing its procedure for entry, descent and landing (EDL), and the spacecraft begins its sequence of autonomous activities leading to the landing this coming weekend.  These activities include enabling needed components and setting final parameters. In addition, the schedule over the next several days includes opportunities to update parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during EDL.  If needed, these updates can fine-tune the spacecraft's autonomous controls for its descent through the atmosphere. Some parameters give the spacecraft's onboard computer knowledge about where the vehicle is relative to Mars. Others may be updated based on observations by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft of Mars' variable atmospheric conditions in this week before landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 29: Course Maneuver Successful; MSL Begins Final Approach</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Late Saturday night, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft successfully fine-tuned its course to better zero in on its target entry point into the Martian atmosphere on landing day. Two brief thruster firings totaling about six seconds altered the spacecraft's velocity slightly, by about one-fortieth of one mile per hour (one centimeter per second). This trajectory correction maneuver the fourth since MSL's launch adjusted the point at which Curiosity will enter the Martian atmosphere by about 13 miles (21 kilometers). On landing day, MSL can steer enough during its flight through the upper atmosphere to correct for a miss of the target entry point by a few miles and still land within its target ellipse. Mission engineers and managers rated the projected 13-mile miss big enough to warrant a correction maneuver. Telemetry and tracking data indicate the maneuver was successful. MSL will have two further opportunities for additional course corrections during the final 48 hours before landing, if needed.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 28: MSL Set to Begin Final Approach</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Tonight the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft is scheduled to perform a very small course adjustment, called Trajectory Correction Maneuver 4 (TCM-4).  Around 10 p.m. PDT (1 a.m. EDT), two brief thruster firings totaling about six seconds will adjust the spacecraft's trajectory to better hone in on Curiosity's target entry point into the Martian atmosphere. This course adjustment will be the fourth performed during MSL's journey between Earth and Mars. The maneuver will turn the spacecraft to its final attitude and mark the start of Curiosity's final approach to the Red Planet. \n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 27: MSL Telemetry Monitoring, Trajectory Tracking Continue</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The flight team continues to monitor the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft's telemetry and track its trajectory. There are no real-time spacecraft activities planned today. Late tomorrow night, the spacecraft is scheduled to perform its fourth and smallest trajectory correction maneuver, which will mark the beginning of MSL's final approach to Mars.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 26: MSL Configured for Final Approach; Flight Team Takes a Breath</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With completion of nearly all work to configure the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft for entry, descent and landing, most of the flight team is getting some well-deserved rest today in preparation for next week's final approach to Mars. There are no planned flight team spacecraft activities today. NASA's Deep Space Network continues to monitor spacecraft telemetry and track the spacecraft's trajectory.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 25: MSL's Terminal Descent Radar System Gets a Checkout</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory's terminal descent sensor is being checked out in preparation for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing. The sensor is a radar system that is mounted on MSL's descent stage. Following separation of MSL's heat shield at an altitude of approximately 5 miles (8 kilometers) and a velocity of approximately 280 mph (125 meters per second), the sensor begins collecting data on the spacecraft's velocity and altitude in preparation for landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 24: Curiosity's Batteries Get a Charge</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, Curiosity's two lithium ion rechargeable batteries are being recharged to 100 percent of capacity in preparation for entry, descent and landing. The batteries, which have been maintained at a 70-percent state of charge during the cruise to Mars, are being recharged using power from Mars Science Laboratory's cruise-stage solar array. The batteries enable Curiosity's power subsystem to meet peak power demands of rover activities when the demand temporarily exceeds the onboard multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG) steady output level. With a capacity of about 42 amp-hours each, the batteries are expected to go through multiple charge-discharge cycles per Martian day.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 23: Prepping MSL's Descent Stage Navigation System for Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Preparations continue for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations. Today, the two inertial measurement units (IMUs) in Mars Science Laboratory's descent stage are being configured, along with other guidance and control parameters for entry, descent and landing. The IMUs are electronic devices that will be used to maneuver the spacecraft's descent stage, measuring and reporting on its velocity, orientation and gravitational forces. The descent stage does its main work during the final few minutes before touchdown on Mars, providing rocket-powered deceleration and two bands of telecommunications for the final phase of MSL's arrival at Mars that includes lowering the Curiosity rover on a bridle and continuing descent until rover touchdown. In addition, more communications parameter updates for Curiosity's surface operations are being uploaded to Curiosity's main computers.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 22: Trajectory Tracking Continues</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Engineers at NASA's Deep Space Network continue to run differential ranging track passes to track Mars Science Laboratory's trajectory. These activities are designed to more closely track the spacecraft's trajectory and position as it draws nearer to the Red Planet and Mars' gravitational influence on the spacecraft increases.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 21: Getting a Better Bead on Trajectory</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, engineers at NASA's Deep Space Network are running two differential ranging track passes to track Mars Science Laboratory's trajectory. These activities are designed to more closely track the spacecraft's trajectory and position as it draws nearer to the Red Planet and Mars' gravitational influence on the spacecraft increases.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 20: Curiosity Completes Week of Onboard Computer Preps</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />As of yesterday evening, the week-long reboot and configuration activities on Curiosity's two redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements -- including the uplink of spacecraft configuration parameters for entry, descent and landing -- were completed, a day ahead of schedule. Today, backup software for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing is being configured onboard the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft. In case Curiosity's prime computer resets for any reason during the critical minutes of entry, descent and landing, this backup software is designed to enable Curiosity's backup computer to promptly take control and finish the landing with a bare-bones version of entry, descent and landing instructions.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 19: More Computer Preps for Curiosity</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With updated flight sequences and communications parameters for entry, descent and landing and surface operations now uploaded to one of Curiosity's two redundant main computers -- Rover Compute Element (RCE)-B -- today RCE-A is being swapped back to become Curiosity's prime computer, and RCE-B is returning to backup mode. Prime computer RCE-A will then receive its own set of updated flight sequences and communications parameters.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 18: Curiosity Continues Computer Preps, Gets 'Attitude Adjustment'</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Activities continue to prepare Curiosity's redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements, for arrival at Mars. Today, Curiosity's RCE-A computer, which was swapped with the backup computer yesterday, is being cold reset, or rebooted, while in online, or backup, mode. Work continues to upload updated flight sequences and communications parameters for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations to the spacecraft. In addition, mission controllers yesterday completed the 21st attitude control turn on the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft, a day early. This turn adjusts the spacecraft's orientation to keep its medium-gain antenna pointed toward Earth for communications.

      "<p>After waking up to the rousing refrains of the Beatles' \"Good Morning Good Morning,\" a healthy Curiosity continued checking out her systems and returning amazing imagery. The Sol 2 morning and afternoon UHF communications passes from NASA's Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft provided significant new data, including spectacular full-frame images of the Mars Science Laboratory's descent through the Martian atmosphere by Curiosity's Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) instrument. Other imagery included full-frame views from the rover's navigation cameras, or Navcams, looking at the rim of Gale Crater; the first, lower-resolution thumbnail 360-degree view of Curiosity's new surroundings in Gale Crater; deck pan images of the rover herself; and images of the Martian surface next to the rover. Another image set, courtesy of the Context Camera, or CTX, aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, has pinpointed the final resting spots of the six, 55-pound (25-kilogram) entry ballast masses.

The team's plans for Curiosity checkout today included raising the rover's mast and continued testing of its high-gain antenna, whose pointing toward Earth will be adjusted on Sol 2. Science data were collected from Curiosity's Radiation Assessment Detector, and activities were performed with the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station instrument. Curiosity transmitted its first color image from the surface of Mars, from the Mars Hand Lens Imager, or MAHLI, showing part of the north rim of Gale Crater. Additional calibration images were received from Curiosity's Navcam and Mastcam. All systems are go for deployment of the rover's remote sensing mast on Sol 2, followed by a 360-degree pan by the rover's Navcam. The Mastcam will also be calibrated against a target image on the rover. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter returned a spectacular image of Curiosity's landing site, depicting the rover, parachute, back shell, heat shield and descent stage.

These include firing all of Curiosity's pyrotechnic devices for releasing post-landing deployments. Spring-loaded deployments, such as removal of dust covers from the Hazard-Avoidance cameras (Hazcams) occur immediately when pyros are fired. Curiosity also took images with its front and rear Hazcams both before and after removal of the dust covers, checked out its UHF telecommunications system and rover motor controller assembly, and completed all activities required to proceed with its planned activities on Sol 1. Approximately five megabytes of data were successfully relayed back to Earth from NASA's Mars Odyssey spacecraft during its overpass today.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity landed facing east-southeast within Gale Crater, with a heading of 112.7 degrees (plus or minus five degrees), and a few degrees of tilt. A Sol 1 overpass by Mars Odyssey will provide additional information on Curiosity's position and additional imagery. A first look at some color images taken just before landing by MSL's Mars Descent Imager also provided additonal information on the rover's precise location.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Activities planned for Sol 1 during the mission's approximately one-month characterization activity phase include deploying Curiosity's high-gain antenna, collecting science data from Curiosity's Radiation Assessment Detector and Rover Environmental Monitoring Station instruments, and obtaining additional imagery.

This morning, flight controllers decided to forgo the sixth and final opportunity on the mission calendar for a course-correction maneuver. The spacecraft is headed for its target entry point at the top of Mars' atmosphere precisely enough that the maneuver was deemed unnecessary. In addition, this afternoon, mission controllers determined that no further updates are necessary to the onboard information the spacecraft will use during its autonomous control of MSL's entry, descent and landing. Parameters on a motion tracker were adjusted Saturday for fine-tuning determination of the spacecraft's orientation during its descent.</p>\n",

Today, the flight team uplinked and confirmed commands to make minor corrections to the spacecraft's navigation reference point parameters.  This afternoon, as part of the onboard sequence of autonomous activities leading to the landing, catalyst bed heaters are being turned on to prepare the eight Mars Lander Engines that are part of MSL's descent propulsion system. As of 2:25 p.m. PDT (5:25 p.m. EDT), MSL was approximately 261,000 miles (420,039 kilometers) from Mars, closing in at a little more than 8,000 mph (about 3,600 meters per second).<br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>Aug. 3: MSL Right on Course - TCM-5 Cancelled</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With less than three days to go before touchdown on the Red Planet, Curiosity remains in good health, with all systems operating as expected. Given the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft's consistent and stable course, today the project decided that the planned Trajectory Correction Maneuver 5 (TCM-5) and its corresponding update to parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during entry, descent and landing will not be necessary. As of 12:35 p.m. today PDT (3:35 p.m. EDT), the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft was approximately 468,000 miles (753,200 kilometers) from Mars, or a little less than twice the distance from Earth to the moon.  It is traveling at about 8,000 mph (3,576 meters per second). It will gradually increase in speed to about 13,200 mph (5,900 meters per second) by the time it reaches the top of the Martian atmosphere. \n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>Aug. 2:  MSL Remains on Track for Weekend Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Curiosity remains in good health, with no significant issues currently in work. There are no real-time activities planned today. The Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft remains on a consistent and stable course, well within the limits required to reach its target landing ellipse. As a result, yesterday the flight team decided to cancel the build and test of a contingency version of Trajectory Correction Maneuver 5. This contingency manuever, had it been needed, would have been used in the event an emergency prevented the team from executing the nominal scheduled TCM-5 maneuver, which is planned for Friday, Aug. 3, if needed. The project also canceled a corresponding update to parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during entry, descent and landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>Aug. 1: Further Preps for Entry, Descent and Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With Curiosity now flying under the control of the autonomous entry, descent and landing timeline, the Mars Science Laboratory team continues to monitor the spacecraft's health and trajectory. There are no real-time activities planned today. In the event that a fifth trajectory correction maneuver is needed to further fine-tune the spacecraft's course to reach its target landing ellipse, the flight team is making preparations for it. If needed, that maneuver would be executed on Friday, Aug. 3. Curiosity remains in good health, with no significant issues currently in work.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 31:  Entry, Descent and Landing Timeline Activated</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The Mars Science Laboratory continues its final preparations for entry, descent and landing this upcoming weekend. Yesterday, the flight team completed and confirmed a memory test on the software for the mechanical assembly that controls MSL's descent motor. They also configured the spacecraft for its transition to entry, descent and landing approach mode, and they enabled the spacecraft's hardware pyrotechnic devices. MSL is now under the control of the autonomous entry, descent and landing timeline flight software. The flight team continues to monitor Curiosity's onboard systems and flight trajectory.  The spacecraft and ground systems remain in good health, with no significant issues currently being worked.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 30:  Entry, Descent and Landing Procedure Begins</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory flight team begins executing its procedure for entry, descent and landing (EDL), and the spacecraft begins its sequence of autonomous activities leading to the landing this coming weekend.  These activities include enabling needed components and setting final parameters. In addition, the schedule over the next several days includes opportunities to update parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during EDL.  If needed, these updates can fine-tune the spacecraft's autonomous controls for its descent through the atmosphere. Some parameters give the spacecraft's onboard computer knowledge about where the vehicle is relative to Mars. Others may be updated based on observations by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft of Mars' variable atmospheric conditions in this week before landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 29: Course Maneuver Successful; MSL Begins Final Approach</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Late Saturday night, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft successfully fine-tuned its course to better zero in on its target entry point into the Martian atmosphere on landing day. Two brief thruster firings totaling about six seconds altered the spacecraft's velocity slightly, by about one-fortieth of one mile per hour (one centimeter per second). This trajectory correction maneuver the fourth since MSL's launch adjusted the point at which Curiosity will enter the Martian atmosphere by about 13 miles (21 kilometers). On landing day, MSL can steer enough during its flight through the upper atmosphere to correct for a miss of the target entry point by a few miles and still land within its target ellipse. Mission engineers and managers rated the projected 13-mile miss big enough to warrant a correction maneuver. Telemetry and tracking data indicate the maneuver was successful. MSL will have two further opportunities for additional course corrections during the final 48 hours before landing, if needed.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 28: MSL Set to Begin Final Approach</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Tonight the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft is scheduled to perform a very small course adjustment, called Trajectory Correction Maneuver 4 (TCM-4).  Around 10 p.m. PDT (1 a.m. EDT), two brief thruster firings totaling about six seconds will adjust the spacecraft's trajectory to better hone in on Curiosity's target entry point into the Martian atmosphere. This course adjustment will be the fourth performed during MSL's journey between Earth and Mars. The maneuver will turn the spacecraft to its final attitude and mark the start of Curiosity's final approach to the Red Planet. \n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 27: MSL Telemetry Monitoring, Trajectory Tracking Continue</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The flight team continues to monitor the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft's telemetry and track its trajectory. There are no real-time spacecraft activities planned today. Late tomorrow night, the spacecraft is scheduled to perform its fourth and smallest trajectory correction maneuver, which will mark the beginning of MSL's final approach to Mars.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 26: MSL Configured for Final Approach; Flight Team Takes a Breath</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With completion of nearly all work to configure the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft for entry, descent and landing, most of the flight team is getting some well-deserved rest today in preparation for next week's final approach to Mars. There are no planned flight team spacecraft activities today. NASA's Deep Space Network continues to monitor spacecraft telemetry and track the spacecraft's trajectory.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 25: MSL's Terminal Descent Radar System Gets a Checkout</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory's terminal descent sensor is being checked out in preparation for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing. The sensor is a radar system that is mounted on MSL's descent stage. Following separation of MSL's heat shield at an altitude of approximately 5 miles (8 kilometers) and a velocity of approximately 280 mph (125 meters per second), the sensor begins collecting data on the spacecraft's velocity and altitude in preparation for landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 24: Curiosity's Batteries Get a Charge</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, Curiosity's two lithium ion rechargeable batteries are being recharged to 100 percent of capacity in preparation for entry, descent and landing. The batteries, which have been maintained at a 70-percent state of charge during the cruise to Mars, are being recharged using power from Mars Science Laboratory's cruise-stage solar array. The batteries enable Curiosity's power subsystem to meet peak power demands of rover activities when the demand temporarily exceeds the onboard multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG) steady output level. With a capacity of about 42 amp-hours each, the batteries are expected to go through multiple charge-discharge cycles per Martian day.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 23: Prepping MSL's Descent Stage Navigation System for Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Preparations continue for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations. Today, the two inertial measurement units (IMUs) in Mars Science Laboratory's descent stage are being configured, along with other guidance and control parameters for entry, descent and landing. The IMUs are electronic devices that will be used to maneuver the spacecraft's descent stage, measuring and reporting on its velocity, orientation and gravitational forces. The descent stage does its main work during the final few minutes before touchdown on Mars, providing rocket-powered deceleration and two bands of telecommunications for the final phase of MSL's arrival at Mars that includes lowering the Curiosity rover on a bridle and continuing descent until rover touchdown. In addition, more communications parameter updates for Curiosity's surface operations are being uploaded to Curiosity's main computers.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 22: Trajectory Tracking Continues</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Engineers at NASA's Deep Space Network continue to run differential ranging track passes to track Mars Science Laboratory's trajectory. These activities are designed to more closely track the spacecraft's trajectory and position as it draws nearer to the Red Planet and Mars' gravitational influence on the spacecraft increases.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 21: Getting a Better Bead on Trajectory</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, engineers at NASA's Deep Space Network are running two differential ranging track passes to track Mars Science Laboratory's trajectory. These activities are designed to more closely track the spacecraft's trajectory and position as it draws nearer to the Red Planet and Mars' gravitational influence on the spacecraft increases.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 20: Curiosity Completes Week of Onboard Computer Preps</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />As of yesterday evening, the week-long reboot and configuration activities on Curiosity's two redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements -- including the uplink of spacecraft configuration parameters for entry, descent and landing -- were completed, a day ahead of schedule. Today, backup software for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing is being configured onboard the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft. In case Curiosity's prime computer resets for any reason during the critical minutes of entry, descent and landing, this backup software is designed to enable Curiosity's backup computer to promptly take control and finish the landing with a bare-bones version of entry, descent and landing instructions.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 19: More Computer Preps for Curiosity</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With updated flight sequences and communications parameters for entry, descent and landing and surface operations now uploaded to one of Curiosity's two redundant main computers -- Rover Compute Element (RCE)-B -- today RCE-A is being swapped back to become Curiosity's prime computer, and RCE-B is returning to backup mode. Prime computer RCE-A will then receive its own set of updated flight sequences and communications parameters.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 18: Curiosity Continues Computer Preps, Gets 'Attitude Adjustment'</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Activities continue to prepare Curiosity's redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements, for arrival at Mars. Today, Curiosity's RCE-A computer, which was swapped with the backup computer yesterday, is being cold reset, or rebooted, while in online, or backup, mode. Work continues to upload updated flight sequences and communications parameters for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations to the spacecraft. In addition, mission controllers yesterday completed the 21st attitude control turn on the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft, a day early. This turn adjusts the spacecraft's orientation to keep its medium-gain antenna pointed toward Earth for communications. This was the second-to-last attitude control turn planned before landing day.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 17: Curiosity Swaps Computers, Gets Updated Arrival Data</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Activities continue through July 20 to prepare Curiosity's redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements, for arrival at Mars. Today, the computer that has been operating as Curiosity's prime computer is being swapped with the backup computer. On Wednesday July 18, that computer will be cold reset, or rebooted, while in online, or backup mode, following the same process used to cold reset the redundant computer on July 16. In addition, beginning today and continuing through July 20, updated flight sequences and communications parameters for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations will be uploaded to the spacecraft.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 16: Curiosity Computer Preps for Arrival</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Beginning today, Curiosity's redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements, will be power-cycled while in the online, or backup mode. The process, called a cold reset, reboots the computer, resetting it to a predictable, default state prior to the mission's arrival at Mars. This activity begins today with the reboot of the backup computer while in the online state and will continue through July 20. Tomorrow, the prime and backup computers will be swapped, and the reboot process will be repeated on Thursday with the other computer.\n",

      "<p>Curiosity is healthy as it continues to familiarize itself with its new home in Gale Crater and check out its systems. The team's plans for Curiosity checkout today included raising the rover's mast and continued testing of its high-gain antenna, whose pointing toward Earth will be adjusted on Sol 2. Science data were collected from Curiosity's Radiation Assessment Detector, and activities were performed with the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station instrument. Curiosity transmitted its first color image from the surface of Mars, from the Mars Hand Lens Imager, or MAHLI, showing part of the north rim of Gale Crater. Additional calibration images were received from Curiosity's Navcam and Mastcam. All systems are go for deployment of the rover's remote sensing mast on Sol 2, followed by a 360-degree pan by the rover's Navcam. The Mastcam will also be calibrated against a target image on the rover. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter returned a spectacular image of Curiosity's landing site, depicting the rover, parachute, back shell, heat shield and descent stage.

Spring-loaded deployments, such as removal of dust covers from the Hazard-Avoidance cameras (Hazcams) occur immediately when pyros are fired. Curiosity also took images with its front and rear Hazcams both before and after removal of the dust covers, checked out its UHF telecommunications system and rover motor controller assembly, and completed all activities required to proceed with its planned activities on Sol 1. Approximately five megabytes of data were successfully relayed back to Earth from NASA's Mars Odyssey spacecraft during its overpass today.</p>\n",

On the lower left, about 2,020 feet (615 meters) away, are the parachute and back shell. The parachute has a constructed diameter of 71 feet (almost 21.5 meters) and an inflated diameter of 51 feet (nearly 16 meters). The back shell remains connected to the chute via 80 suspension lines that are 165 feet (50 meters) long.

      "<br />With Curiosity now safely on the surface of the Red Planet after last night's spectacular entry, descent and landing in Gale Crater, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory begins its planned primary one-Martian-year (98-week) mission of discovery and exploration. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>On its first Martian day, designated Sol 0, the rover is checking its health and measuring its tilt. All Sol 0 spacecraft activities appear to have been completely nominal. These include firing all of Curiosity's pyrotechnic devices for releasing post-landing deployments. Spring-loaded deployments, such as removal of dust covers from the Hazard-Avoidance cameras (Hazcams) occur immediately when pyros are fired. Curiosity also took images with its front and rear Hazcams both before and after removal of the dust covers, checked out its UHF telecommunications system and rover motor controller assembly, and completed all activities required to proceed with its planned activities on Sol 1. Approximately five megabytes of data were successfully relayed back to Earth from NASA's Mars Odyssey spacecraft during its overpass today.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity landed facing east-southeast within Gale Crater, with a heading of 112.7 degrees (plus or minus five degrees), and a few degrees of tilt. A Sol 1 overpass by Mars Odyssey will provide additional information on Curiosity's position and additional imagery. A first look at some color images taken just before landing by MSL's Mars Descent Imager also provided additonal information on the rover's precise location.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Activities planned for Sol 1 during the mission's approximately one-month characterization activity phase include deploying Curiosity's high-gain antenna, collecting science data from Curiosity's Radiation Assessment Detector and Rover Environmental Monitoring Station instruments, and obtaining additional imagery. The mission's characterization activity phase is design to learn how all Curiosity's subsystems and instruments are functioning after landing and within the environment and gravitational field of Mars.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><h3>Aug. 5: Curiosity Set for Mars Landing Tonight</h3>\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />Its approximately 352 million mile (567 million kilometer), 36-week journey from Earth nearly complete, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft and its Curiosity rover are \"all systems go\" for touchdown in Mars' Gale Crater tonight at 10:31 p.m. PDT (1:31 a.m. EDT Aug. 6). This morning, flight controllers decided to forgo the sixth and final opportunity on the mission calendar for a course-correction maneuver. The spacecraft is headed for its target entry point at the top of Mars' atmosphere precisely enough that the maneuver was deemed unnecessary. In addition, this afternoon, mission controllers determined that no further updates are necessary to the onboard information the spacecraft will use during its autonomous control of MSL's entry, descent and landing. Parameters on a motion tracker were adjusted Saturday for fine-tuning determination of the spacecraft's orientation during its descent.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>As of 6:18 p.m. PDT (9:18 p.m. EDT), MSL was approximately 36,000 miles (57,936 kilometers) from Mars, traveling at a speed of about 8,400 mph (about 3,755 meters per second).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><h3>Aug. 4: Curiosity Closes in on its New 'Home'</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With Mars looming ever larger in front of it, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft and its Curiosity rover are in the final stages of preparing for entry, descent and landing on the Red Planet at 10:31 p.m. PDT Aug. 5 (1:31 a.m. EDT Aug. 6). Curiosity remains in good health with all systems operating as expected.  Today, the flight team uplinked and confirmed commands to make minor corrections to the spacecraft's navigation reference point parameters.  This afternoon, as part of the onboard sequence of autonomous activities leading to the landing, catalyst bed heaters are being turned on to prepare the eight Mars Lander Engines that are part of MSL's descent propulsion system. As of 2:25 p.m. PDT (5:25 p.m. EDT), MSL was approximately 261,000 miles (420,039 kilometers) from Mars, closing in at a little more than 8,000 mph (about 3,600 meters per second).<br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>Aug. 3: MSL Right on Course - TCM-5 Cancelled</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With less than three days to go before touchdown on the Red Planet, Curiosity remains in good health, with all systems operating as expected. Given the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft's consistent and stable course, today the project decided that the planned Trajectory Correction Maneuver 5 (TCM-5) and its corresponding update to parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during entry, descent and landing will not be necessary. As of 12:35 p.m. today PDT (3:35 p.m. EDT), the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft was approximately 468,000 miles (753,200 kilometers) from Mars, or a little less than twice the distance from Earth to the moon.  It is traveling at about 8,000 mph (3,576 meters per second). It will gradually increase in speed to about 13,200 mph (5,900 meters per second) by the time it reaches the top of the Martian atmosphere. \n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>Aug. 2:  MSL Remains on Track for Weekend Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Curiosity remains in good health, with no significant issues currently in work. There are no real-time activities planned today. The Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft remains on a consistent and stable course, well within the limits required to reach its target landing ellipse. As a result, yesterday the flight team decided to cancel the build and test of a contingency version of Trajectory Correction Maneuver 5. This contingency manuever, had it been needed, would have been used in the event an emergency prevented the team from executing the nominal scheduled TCM-5 maneuver, which is planned for Friday, Aug. 3, if needed. The project also canceled a corresponding update to parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during entry, descent and landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>Aug. 1: Further Preps for Entry, Descent and Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With Curiosity now flying under the control of the autonomous entry, descent and landing timeline, the Mars Science Laboratory team continues to monitor the spacecraft's health and trajectory. There are no real-time activities planned today. In the event that a fifth trajectory correction maneuver is needed to further fine-tune the spacecraft's course to reach its target landing ellipse, the flight team is making preparations for it. If needed, that maneuver would be executed on Friday, Aug. 3. Curiosity remains in good health, with no significant issues currently in work.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 31:  Entry, Descent and Landing Timeline Activated</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The Mars Science Laboratory continues its final preparations for entry, descent and landing this upcoming weekend. Yesterday, the flight team completed and confirmed a memory test on the software for the mechanical assembly that controls MSL's descent motor. They also configured the spacecraft for its transition to entry, descent and landing approach mode, and they enabled the spacecraft's hardware pyrotechnic devices. MSL is now under the control of the autonomous entry, descent and landing timeline flight software. The flight team continues to monitor Curiosity's onboard systems and flight trajectory.  The spacecraft and ground systems remain in good health, with no significant issues currently being worked.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 30:  Entry, Descent and Landing Procedure Begins</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory flight team begins executing its procedure for entry, descent and landing (EDL), and the spacecraft begins its sequence of autonomous activities leading to the landing this coming weekend.  These activities include enabling needed components and setting final parameters. In addition, the schedule over the next several days includes opportunities to update parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during EDL.  If needed, these updates can fine-tune the spacecraft's autonomous controls for its descent through the atmosphere. Some parameters give the spacecraft's onboard computer knowledge about where the vehicle is relative to Mars. Others may be updated based on observations by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft of Mars' variable atmospheric conditions in this week before landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 29: Course Maneuver Successful; MSL Begins Final Approach</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Late Saturday night, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft successfully fine-tuned its course to better zero in on its target entry point into the Martian atmosphere on landing day. Two brief thruster firings totaling about six seconds altered the spacecraft's velocity slightly, by about one-fortieth of one mile per hour (one centimeter per second). This trajectory correction maneuver the fourth since MSL's launch adjusted the point at which Curiosity will enter the Martian atmosphere by about 13 miles (21 kilometers). On landing day, MSL can steer enough during its flight through the upper atmosphere to correct for a miss of the target entry point by a few miles and still land within its target ellipse. Mission engineers and managers rated the projected 13-mile miss big enough to warrant a correction maneuver. Telemetry and tracking data indicate the maneuver was successful. MSL will have two further opportunities for additional course corrections during the final 48 hours before landing, if needed.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 28: MSL Set to Begin Final Approach</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Tonight the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft is scheduled to perform a very small course adjustment, called Trajectory Correction Maneuver 4 (TCM-4).  Around 10 p.m. PDT (1 a.m. EDT), two brief thruster firings totaling about six seconds will adjust the spacecraft's trajectory to better hone in on Curiosity's target entry point into the Martian atmosphere. This course adjustment will be the fourth performed during MSL's journey between Earth and Mars. The maneuver will turn the spacecraft to its final attitude and mark the start of Curiosity's final approach to the Red Planet. \n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 27: MSL Telemetry Monitoring, Trajectory Tracking Continue</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The flight team continues to monitor the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft's telemetry and track its trajectory. There are no real-time spacecraft activities planned today. Late tomorrow night, the spacecraft is scheduled to perform its fourth and smallest trajectory correction maneuver, which will mark the beginning of MSL's final approach to Mars.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 26: MSL Configured for Final Approach; Flight Team Takes a Breath</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With completion of nearly all work to configure the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft for entry, descent and landing, most of the flight team is getting some well-deserved rest today in preparation for next week's final approach to Mars. There are no planned flight team spacecraft activities today. NASA's Deep Space Network continues to monitor spacecraft telemetry and track the spacecraft's trajectory.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 25: MSL's Terminal Descent Radar System Gets a Checkout</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory's terminal descent sensor is being checked out in preparation for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing. The sensor is a radar system that is mounted on MSL's descent stage. Following separation of MSL's heat shield at an altitude of approximately 5 miles (8 kilometers) and a velocity of approximately 280 mph (125 meters per second), the sensor begins collecting data on the spacecraft's velocity and altitude in preparation for landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 24: Curiosity's Batteries Get a Charge</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, Curiosity's two lithium ion rechargeable batteries are being recharged to 100 percent of capacity in preparation for entry, descent and landing. The batteries, which have been maintained at a 70-percent state of charge during the cruise to Mars, are being recharged using power from Mars Science Laboratory's cruise-stage solar array. The batteries enable Curiosity's power subsystem to meet peak power demands of rover activities when the demand temporarily exceeds the onboard multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG) steady output level. With a capacity of about 42 amp-hours each, the batteries are expected to go through multiple charge-discharge cycles per Martian day.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 23: Prepping MSL's Descent Stage Navigation System for Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Preparations continue for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations. Today, the two inertial measurement units (IMUs) in Mars Science Laboratory's descent stage are being configured, along with other guidance and control parameters for entry, descent and landing. The IMUs are electronic devices that will be used to maneuver the spacecraft's descent stage, measuring and reporting on its velocity, orientation and gravitational forces. The descent stage does its main work during the final few minutes before touchdown on Mars, providing rocket-powered deceleration and two bands of telecommunications for the final phase of MSL's arrival at Mars that includes lowering the Curiosity rover on a bridle and continuing descent until rover touchdown. In addition, more communications parameter updates for Curiosity's surface operations are being uploaded to Curiosity's main computers.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 22: Trajectory Tracking Continues</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Engineers at NASA's Deep Space Network continue to run differential ranging track passes to track Mars Science Laboratory's trajectory. These activities are designed to more closely track the spacecraft's trajectory and position as it draws nearer to the Red Planet and Mars' gravitational influence on the spacecraft increases.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 21: Getting a Better Bead on Trajectory</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, engineers at NASA's Deep Space Network are running two differential ranging track passes to track Mars Science Laboratory's trajectory. These activities are designed to more closely track the spacecraft's trajectory and position as it draws nearer to the Red Planet and Mars' gravitational influence on the spacecraft increases.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 20: Curiosity Completes Week of Onboard Computer Preps</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />As of yesterday evening, the week-long reboot and configuration activities on Curiosity's two redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements -- including the uplink of spacecraft configuration parameters for entry, descent and landing -- were completed, a day ahead of schedule. Today, backup software for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing is being configured onboard the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft. In case Curiosity's prime computer resets for any reason during the critical minutes of entry, descent and landing, this backup software is designed to enable Curiosity's backup computer to promptly take control and finish the landing with a bare-bones version of entry, descent and landing instructions.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 19: More Computer Preps for Curiosity</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With updated flight sequences and communications parameters for entry, descent and landing and surface operations now uploaded to one of Curiosity's two redundant main computers -- Rover Compute Element (RCE)-B -- today RCE-A is being swapped back to become Curiosity's prime computer, and RCE-B is returning to backup mode. Prime computer RCE-A will then receive its own set of updated flight sequences and communications parameters.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",

The 297 color, low-resolution images, provide a glimpse of the rover's descent into Gale Crater. They are a preview of the approximately 1,504 images of descent currently held in the rover's onboard memory.

One of the earliest images shows the entry vehicle's heat shield 50 feet (15 meters) and falling away after separating from the vehicle three seconds before. A set of images demonstrates some of the gyrations Curiosity went through while on the parachute. Another remarkable set of images depicts the final moments leading up to landing, where the exhaust from four of the descent stage's 742 pounds of thrust rockets billow up dust from the Martian surface.</p>\n",

      "<br />NASA's Mars Science Laboratory carrying the Curiosity rover has separated from the cruise stage that carried it from Earth to the Red Planet. The rover, snug between a protective back shell and heat shield, is about 10 minutes away from entering the Martian atmosphere and about 17 minutes away from landing. Thrusters on the back shell are orienting the spacecraft so the heat shield faces forward in preparation for entering the atmosphere. At this stage, the Mars Science Laboratory Entry, Descent and Landing Instrument (MEDLI) suite begins taking measurements related to the performance of the heat shield that will aid in the design of future missions.</p>\n",

      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />NASA's Mars Science Laboratory has entered the Martian atmosphere. The top of Mars’ atmosphere is a gradual transition to interplanetary space, not a sharp boundary. In addition, the entry point is not directly above the landing site. While descending from that altitude to the surface, the spacecraft will also be traveling eastward relative to the Mars surface, covering a ground-track distance of about 390 miles (about 630 kilometers) between the atmospheric entry point and the touchdown target. Two tungsten weights will be released to shift the spacecraft's center of mass and give it the lift it needs to fly through the atmosphere.\n",

      "<br />NASA's Curiosity rover has landed on Mars! Its descent-stage retrorockets fired, guiding it to the surface. Nylon cords lowered the rover to the ground in the \"sky crane\" maneuver. When the spacecraft sensed touchdown, the connecting cords were severed, and the descent stage flew out of the way. The time of day at the landing site is mid-afternoon - about 3 p.m. local Mars time at Gale Crater. The time at JPL's mission control is about 10:31 p.m. Aug. 5 PDT (early morning EDT).  \n",

      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />Its approximately 352 million mile (567 million kilometer), 36-week journey from Earth nearly complete, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft and its Curiosity rover are \"all systems go\" for touchdown in Mars' Gale Crater tonight at 10:31 p.m. PDT (1:31 a.m. EDT Aug. 6). This morning, flight controllers decided to forgo the sixth and final opportunity on the mission calendar for a course-correction maneuver. The spacecraft is headed for its target entry point at the top of Mars' atmosphere precisely enough that the maneuver was deemed unnecessary. In addition, this afternoon, mission controllers determined that no further updates are necessary to the onboard information the spacecraft will use during its autonomous control of MSL's entry, descent and landing. Parameters on a motion tracker were adjusted Saturday for fine-tuning determination of the spacecraft's orientation during its descent.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>As of 6:18 p.m. PDT (9:18 p.m. EDT), MSL was approximately 36,000 miles (57,936 kilometers) from Mars, traveling at a speed of about 8,400 mph (about 3,755 meters per second).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><h3>Aug. 3: MSL Right on Course - TCM-5 Cancelled</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With less than three days to go before touchdown on the Red Planet, Curiosity remains in good health, with all systems operating as expected. Given the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft's consistent and stable course, today the project decided that the planned Trajectory Correction Maneuver 5 (TCM-5) and its corresponding update to parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during entry, descent and landing will not be necessary. As of 12:35 p.m. today PDT (3:35 p.m. EDT), the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft was approximately 468,000 miles (753,200 kilometers) from Mars, or a little less than twice the distance from Earth to the moon.  It is traveling at about 8,000 mph (3,576 meters per second). It will gradually increase in speed to about 13,200 mph (5,900 meters per second) by the time it reaches the top of the Martian atmosphere. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><h3>Aug. 2:  MSL Remains on Track for Weekend Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Curiosity remains in good health, with no significant issues currently in work. There are no real-time activities planned today. The Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft remains on a consistent and stable course, well within the limits required to reach its target landing ellipse. As a result, yesterday the flight team decided to cancel the build and test of a contingency version of Trajectory Correction Maneuver 5. This contingency manuever, had it been needed, would have been used in the event an emergency prevented the team from executing the nominal scheduled TCM-5 maneuver, which is planned for Friday, Aug. 3, if needed. The project also canceled a corresponding update to parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during entry, descent and landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>Aug. 1: Further Preps for Entry, Descent and Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With Curiosity now flying under the control of the autonomous entry, descent and landing timeline, the Mars Science Laboratory team continues to monitor the spacecraft's health and trajectory. There are no real-time activities planned today. In the event that a fifth trajectory correction maneuver is needed to further fine-tune the spacecraft's course to reach its target landing ellipse, the flight team is making preparations for it. If needed, that maneuver would be executed on Friday, Aug. 3. Curiosity remains in good health, with no significant issues currently in work.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 31:  Entry, Descent and Landing Timeline Activated</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The Mars Science Laboratory continues its final preparations for entry, descent and landing this upcoming weekend. Yesterday, the flight team completed and confirmed a memory test on the software for the mechanical assembly that controls MSL’s descent motor. They also configured the spacecraft for its transition to entry, descent and landing approach mode, and they enabled the spacecraft’s hardware pyrotechnic devices. MSL is now under the control of the autonomous entry, descent and landing timeline flight software. The flight team continues to monitor Curiosity's onboard systems and flight trajectory.  The spacecraft and ground systems remain in good health, with no significant issues currently being worked.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 30:  Entry, Descent and Landing Procedure Begins</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory flight team begins executing its procedure for entry, descent and landing (EDL), and the spacecraft begins its sequence of autonomous activities leading to the landing this coming weekend.  These activities include enabling needed components and setting final parameters. In addition, the schedule over the next several days includes opportunities to update parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during EDL.  If needed, these updates can fine-tune the spacecraft's autonomous controls for its descent through the atmosphere. Some parameters give the spacecraft's onboard computer knowledge about where the vehicle is relative to Mars. Others may be updated based on observations by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft of Mars' variable atmospheric conditions in this week before landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 29: Course Maneuver Successful; MSL Begins Final Approach</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Late Saturday night, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft successfully fine-tuned its course to better zero in on its target entry point into the Martian atmosphere on landing day. Two brief thruster firings totaling about six seconds altered the spacecraft's velocity slightly, by about one-fortieth of one mile per hour (one centimeter per second). This trajectory correction maneuver—the fourth since MSL's launch—adjusted the point at which Curiosity will enter the Martian atmosphere by about 13 miles (21 kilometers). On landing day, MSL can steer enough during its flight through the upper atmosphere to correct for a miss of the target entry point by a few miles and still land within its target ellipse. Mission engineers and managers rated the projected 13-mile miss big enough to warrant a correction maneuver. Telemetry and tracking data indicate the maneuver was successful. MSL will have two further opportunities for additional course corrections during the final 48 hours before landing, if needed.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 28: MSL Set to Begin Final Approach</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Tonight the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft is scheduled to perform a very small course adjustment, called Trajectory Correction Maneuver 4 (TCM-4).  Around 10 p.m. PDT (1 a.m. EDT), two brief thruster firings totaling about six seconds will adjust the spacecraft's trajectory to better hone in on Curiosity's target entry point into the Martian atmosphere. This course adjustment will be the fourth performed during MSL's journey between Earth and Mars. The maneuver will turn the spacecraft to its final attitude and mark the start of Curiosity's final approach to the Red Planet. \n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 27: MSL Telemetry Monitoring, Trajectory Tracking Continue</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The flight team continues to monitor the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft's telemetry and track its trajectory. There are no real-time spacecraft activities planned today. Late tomorrow night, the spacecraft is scheduled to perform its fourth and smallest trajectory correction maneuver, which will mark the beginning of MSL's final approach to Mars.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 26: MSL Configured for Final Approach; Flight Team Takes a Breath</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With completion of nearly all work to configure the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft for entry, descent and landing, most of the flight team is getting some well-deserved rest today in preparation for next week's final approach to Mars. There are no planned flight team spacecraft activities today. NASA's Deep Space Network continues to monitor spacecraft telemetry and track the spacecraft's trajectory.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 25: MSL's Terminal Descent Radar System Gets a Checkout</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory's terminal descent sensor is being checked out in preparation for Curiosity’s entry, descent and landing. The sensor is a radar system that is mounted on MSL's descent stage. Following separation of MSL's heat shield at an altitude of approximately 5 miles (8 kilometers) and a velocity of approximately 280 mph (125 meters per second), the sensor begins collecting data on the spacecraft's velocity and altitude in preparation for landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 24: Curiosity's Batteries Get a Charge</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, Curiosity's two lithium ion rechargeable batteries are being recharged to 100 percent of capacity in preparation for entry, descent and landing. The batteries, which have been maintained at a 70-percent state of charge during the cruise to Mars, are being recharged using power from Mars Science Laboratory's cruise-stage solar array. The batteries enable Curiosity's power subsystem to meet peak power demands of rover activities when the demand temporarily exceeds the onboard multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG) steady output level. With a capacity of about 42 amp-hours each, the batteries are expected to go through multiple charge-discharge cycles per Martian day.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 23: Prepping MSL's Descent Stage Navigation System for Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Preparations continue for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations. Today, the two inertial measurement units (IMUs) in Mars Science Laboratory's descent stage are being configured, along with other guidance and control parameters for entry, descent and landing. The IMUs are electronic devices that will be used to maneuver the spacecraft's descent stage, measuring and reporting on its velocity, orientation and gravitational forces. The descent stage does its main work during the final few minutes before touchdown on Mars, providing rocket-powered deceleration and two bands of telecommunications for the final phase of MSL's arrival at Mars that includes lowering the Curiosity rover on a bridle and continuing descent until rover touchdown. In addition, more communications parameter updates for Curiosity's surface operations are being uploaded to Curiosity's main computers.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 22: Trajectory Tracking Continues</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Engineers at NASA's Deep Space Network continue to run differential ranging track passes to track Mars Science Laboratory's trajectory. These activities are designed to more closely track the spacecraft's trajectory and position as it draws nearer to the Red Planet and Mars' gravitational influence on the spacecraft increases.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 21: Getting a Better Bead on Trajectory</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, engineers at NASA's Deep Space Network are running two differential ranging track passes to track Mars Science Laboratory's trajectory. These activities are designed to more closely track the spacecraft's trajectory and position as it draws nearer to the Red Planet and Mars' gravitational influence on the spacecraft increases.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 20: Curiosity Completes Week of Onboard Computer Preps</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />As of yesterday evening, the week-long reboot and configuration activities on Curiosity's two redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements -- including the uplink of spacecraft configuration parameters for entry, descent and landing -- were completed, a day ahead of schedule. Today, backup software for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing is being configured onboard the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft. In case Curiosity's prime computer resets for any reason during the critical minutes of entry, descent and landing, this backup software is designed to enable Curiosity's backup computer to promptly take control and finish the landing with a bare-bones version of entry, descent and landing instructions.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 19: More Computer Preps for Curiosity</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With updated flight sequences and communications parameters for entry, descent and landing and surface operations now uploaded to one of Curiosity's two redundant main computers -- Rover Compute Element (RCE)-B -- today RCE-A is being swapped back to become Curiosity's prime computer, and RCE-B is returning to backup mode. Prime computer RCE-A will then receive its own set of updated flight sequences and communications parameters.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 18: Curiosity Continues Computer Preps, Gets 'Attitude Adjustment'</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Activities continue to prepare Curiosity's redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements, for arrival at Mars. Today, Curiosity's RCE-A computer, which was swapped with the backup computer yesterday, is being cold reset, or rebooted, while in online, or backup, mode. Work continues to upload updated flight sequences and communications parameters for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations to the spacecraft. In addition, mission controllers yesterday completed the 21st attitude control turn on the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft, a day early. This turn adjusts the spacecraft's orientation to keep its medium-gain antenna pointed toward Earth for communications. This was the second-to-last attitude control turn planned before landing day.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 17: Curiosity Swaps Computers, Gets Updated Arrival Data</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Activities continue through July 20 to prepare Curiosity’s redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements, for arrival at Mars. Today, the computer that has been operating as Curiosity’s prime computer is being swapped with the backup computer. On Wednesday July 18, that computer will be cold reset, or rebooted, while in online, or backup mode, following the same process used to cold reset the redundant computer on July 16. In addition, beginning today and continuing through July 20, updated flight sequences and communications parameters for Curiosity’s entry, descent and landing and surface operations will be uploaded to the spacecraft.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 16: Curiosity Computer Preps for Arrival</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Beginning today, Curiosity's redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements, will be power-cycled while in the online, or backup mode. The process, called a cold reset, reboots the computer, resetting it to a predictable, default state prior to the mission's arrival at Mars. This activity begins today with the reboot of the backup computer while in the online state and will continue through July 20. Tomorrow, the prime and backup computers will be swapped, and the reboot process will be repeated on Thursday with the other computer.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 13: Radiation Instrument Finishes Inflight Measurements</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The Radiation Assessment Detector instrument on Curiosity has finished the measurements it had been making during its flight from Earth to Mars. It will be configured for surface operations and turned off today and remain turned off until after landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 12: MSL Team Has Final Test of Landing Procedures</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory flight team is conducting a final operations readiness test of entry, descent and landing procedures in preparation for Curiosity's landing on Aug. 5, PDT.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 11: MSL Complete Turn</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The Mars Science Laboratory Spacecraft completed an attitude control turn today, adjusting its orientation for keeping its medium-gain antenna pointed toward Earth for communications. This was the third-to-last attitude control turn planned before landing day.</p>\n",

      "<br />With Mars looming ever larger in front of it, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft and its Curiosity rover are in the final stages of preparing for entry, descent and landing on the Red Planet at 10:31 p.m. PDT Aug. 5 (1:31 a.m. EDT Aug. 6). Curiosity remains in good health with all systems operating as expected.  Today, the flight team uplinked and confirmed commands to make minor corrections to the spacecraft's navigation reference point parameters.  This afternoon, as part of the onboard sequence of autonomous activities leading to the landing, catalyst bed heaters are being turned on to prepare the eight Mars Lander Engines that are part of MSL's descent propulsion system. As of 2:25 p.m. PDT (5:25 p.m. EDT), MSL was approximately 261,000 miles (420,039 kilometers) from Mars, closing in at a little more than 8,000 mph (about 3,600 meters per second).\n",

      "<br /><h3>Aug. 2:  MSL Remains on Track for Weekend Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Curiosity remains in good health, with no significant issues currently in work. There are no real-time activities planned today. The Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft remains on a consistent and stable course, well within the limits required to reach its target landing ellipse. As a result, yesterday the flight team decided to cancel the build and test of a contingency version of Trajectory Correction Maneuver 5. This contingency manuever, had it been needed, would have been used in the event an emergency prevented the team from executing the nominal scheduled TCM-5 maneuver, which is planned for Friday, Aug. 3, if needed. The project also canceled a corresponding update to parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during entry, descent and landing.\n",

      "<br /><h3>July 31:  Entry, Descent and Landing Timeline Activated</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The Mars Science Laboratory continues its final preparations for entry, descent and landing this upcoming weekend. Yesterday, the flight team completed and confirmed a memory test on the software for the mechanical assembly that controls MSL’s descent motor. They also configured the spacecraft for its transition to entry, descent and landing approach mode, and they enabled the spacecraft’s hardware pyrotechnic devices. MSL is now under the control of the autonomous entry, descent and landing timeline flight software. The flight team continues to monitor Curiosity's onboard systems and flight trajectory.  The spacecraft and ground systems remain in good health, with no significant issues currently being worked.\n",

      "<br /><h3>July 30:  Entry, Descent and Landing Procedure Begins</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory flight team begins executing its procedure for entry, descent and landing (EDL), and the spacecraft begins its sequence of autonomous activities leading to the landing this coming weekend.  These activities include enabling needed components and setting final parameters. In addition, the schedule over the next several days includes opportunities to update parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during EDL.  If needed, these updates can fine-tune the spacecraft's autonomous controls for its descent through the atmosphere. Some parameters give the spacecraft's onboard computer knowledge about where the vehicle is relative to Mars. Others may be updated based on observations by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft of Mars' variable atmospheric conditions in this week before landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 29: Course Maneuver Successful; MSL Begins Final Approach</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Late Saturday night, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft successfully fine-tuned its course to better zero in on its target entry point into the Martian atmosphere on landing day. Two brief thruster firings totaling about six seconds altered the spacecraft's velocity slightly, by about one-fortieth of one mile per hour (one centimeter per second). This trajectory correction maneuver the fourth since MSL's launch adjusted the point at which Curiosity will enter the Martian atmosphere by about 13 miles (21 kilometers). On landing day, MSL can steer enough during its flight through the upper atmosphere to correct for a miss of the target entry point by a few miles and still land within its target ellipse. Mission engineers and managers rated the projected 13-mile miss big enough to warrant a correction maneuver. Telemetry and tracking data indicate the maneuver was successful. MSL will have two further opportunities for additional course corrections during the final 48 hours before landing, if needed.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 28: MSL Set to Begin Final Approach</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Tonight the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft is scheduled to perform a very small course adjustment, called Trajectory Correction Maneuver 4 (TCM-4).  Around 10 p.m. PDT (1 a.m. EDT), two brief thruster firings totaling about six seconds will adjust the spacecraft's trajectory to better hone in on Curiosity's target entry point into the Martian atmosphere. This course adjustment will be the fourth performed during MSL's journey between Earth and Mars. The maneuver will turn the spacecraft to its final attitude and mark the start of Curiosity's final approach to the Red Planet. \n",

      "<br />With completion of nearly all work to configure the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft for entry, descent and landing, most of the flight team is getting some well-deserved rest today in preparation for next week's final approach to Mars. There are no planned flight team spacecraft activities today. NASA's Deep Space Network continues to monitor spacecraft telemetry and track the spacecraft's trajectory.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 25: MSL's Terminal Descent Radar System Gets a Checkout</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory's terminal descent sensor is being checked out in preparation for Curiosity’s entry, descent and landing. The sensor is a radar system that is mounted on MSL's descent stage. Following separation of MSL's heat shield at an altitude of approximately 5 miles (8 kilometers) and a velocity of approximately 280 mph (125 meters per second), the sensor begins collecting data on the spacecraft's velocity and altitude in preparation for landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 24: Curiosity's Batteries Get a Charge</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, Curiosity's two lithium ion rechargeable batteries are being recharged to 100 percent of capacity in preparation for entry, descent and landing. The batteries, which have been maintained at a 70-percent state of charge during the cruise to Mars, are being recharged using power from Mars Science Laboratory's cruise-stage solar array. The batteries enable Curiosity's power subsystem to meet peak power demands of rover activities when the demand temporarily exceeds the onboard multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG) steady output level. With a capacity of about 42 amp-hours each, the batteries are expected to go through multiple charge-discharge cycles per Martian day.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 23: Prepping MSL's Descent Stage Navigation System for Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Preparations continue for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations. Today, the two inertial measurement units (IMUs) in Mars Science Laboratory's descent stage are being configured, along with other guidance and control parameters for entry, descent and landing. The IMUs are electronic devices that will be used to maneuver the spacecraft's descent stage, measuring and reporting on its velocity, orientation and gravitational forces. The descent stage does its main work during the final few minutes before touchdown on Mars, providing rocket-powered deceleration and two bands of telecommunications for the final phase of MSL's arrival at Mars that includes lowering the Curiosity rover on a bridle and continuing descent until rover touchdown. In addition, more communications parameter updates for Curiosity's surface operations are being uploaded to Curiosity's main computers.\n",

      "<br /><h3>July 20: Curiosity Completes Week of Onboard Computer Preps</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />As of yesterday evening, the week-long reboot and configuration activities on Curiosity's two redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements -- including the uplink of spacecraft configuration parameters for entry, descent and landing -- were completed, a day ahead of schedule. Today, backup software for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing is being configured onboard the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft. In case Curiosity's prime computer resets for any reason during the critical minutes of entry, descent and landing, this backup software is designed to enable Curiosity's backup computer to promptly take control and finish the landing with a bare-bones version of entry, descent and landing instructions.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 19: More Computer Preps for Curiosity</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With updated flight sequences and communications parameters for entry, descent and landing and surface operations now uploaded to one of Curiosity's two redundant main computers -- Rover Compute Element (RCE)-B -- today RCE-A is being swapped back to become Curiosity's prime computer, and RCE-B is returning to backup mode. Prime computer RCE-A will then receive its own set of updated flight sequences and communications parameters.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 18: Curiosity Continues Computer Preps, Gets 'Attitude Adjustment'</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Activities continue to prepare Curiosity's redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements, for arrival at Mars. Today, Curiosity's RCE-A computer, which was swapped with the backup computer yesterday, is being cold reset, or rebooted, while in online, or backup, mode. Work continues to upload updated flight sequences and communications parameters for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations to the spacecraft. In addition, mission controllers yesterday completed the 21st attitude control turn on the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft, a day early. This turn adjusts the spacecraft's orientation to keep its medium-gain antenna pointed toward Earth for communications. This was the second-to-last attitude control turn planned before landing day.\n",

      "<br /><h3>July 17: Curiosity Swaps Computers, Gets Updated Arrival Data</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Activities continue through July 20 to prepare Curiosity’s redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements, for arrival at Mars. Today, the computer that has been operating as Curiosity’s prime computer is being swapped with the backup computer. On Wednesday July 18, that computer will be cold reset, or rebooted, while in online, or backup mode, following the same process used to cold reset the redundant computer on July 16. In addition, beginning today and continuing through July 20, updated flight sequences and communications parameters for Curiosity’s entry, descent and landing and surface operations will be uploaded to the spacecraft.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 16: Curiosity Computer Preps for Arrival</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Beginning today, Curiosity's redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements, will be power-cycled while in the online, or backup mode. The process, called a cold reset, reboots the computer, resetting it to a predictable, default state prior to the mission's arrival at Mars. This activity begins today with the reboot of the backup computer while in the online state and will continue through July 20. Tomorrow, the prime and backup computers will be swapped, and the reboot process will be repeated on Thursday with the other computer.\n",

      "<br />PASADENA, Calif. - The gravitational tug of Mars is now pulling NASA's car-size geochemistry laboratory, Curiosity, in for a suspenseful landing in less than 40 hours.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />\"After flying more than eight months and 350 million miles since launch, the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft is now right on target to fly through the eye of the needle that is our target at the top of the Mars atmosphere,\" said Mission Manager Arthur Amador of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />The spacecraft is healthy and on course for delivering the mission's Curiosity rover close to a Martian mountain at 10:31 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 5 PDT (1:31 a.m. Monday, Aug. 6 EDT). That's the time a signal confirming safe landing could reach Earth, give or take about a minute for the spacecraft's adjustments to sense changeable atmospheric conditions.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />The only way a safe-landing confirmation can arrive during that first opportunity is via a relay by NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter. Curiosity will not be communicating directly with Earth as it lands, because Earth will set beneath the Martian horizon from Curiosity's perspective about two minutes before the landing.  \n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />\"We are expecting Odyssey to relay good news,\" said Steve Sell of the JPL engineering team that developed and tested the mission's complicated \"sky crane\" landing system. \"That moment has been more than eight years in the making.\"\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />A dust storm in southern Mars being monitored by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter appears to be dissipating. \"Mars is cooperating by providing good weather for landing,\" said JPL's Ashwin Vasavada, deputy project scientist for Curiosity.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />Curiosity was approaching Mars at about 8,000 mph (about 3,600 meters per second) Saturday morning. By the time the spacecraft hits the top of Mars' atmosphere, about seven minutes before touchdown, gravity will accelerate it to about 13,200 mph (5,900 meters per second). \n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />NASA plans to use Curiosity to investigate whether the study area has ever offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life, including chemical ingredients for life.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />\"In the first few weeks after landing, we will be ramping up science activities gradually as we complete a series of checkouts and we gain practice at operating this complex robot in Martian conditions,\" said JPL's Richard Cook, deputy project manager for Curiosity. \n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />The first Mars pictures expected from Curiosity are reduced-resolution fisheye black-and-white images received either in the first few minutes after touchdown or more than two hours later. Higher resolution and color images from other cameras could come later in the first week. Plans call for Curiosity to deploy a directional antenna on the first day after landing and raise the camera mast on the second day. \n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />The big hurdle is landing. Under some possible scenarios, Curiosity could land safely, but temporary communication difficulties could delay for hours or even days any confirmation that the rover has survived landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />The prime mission lasts a full Martian year, which is nearly two Earth years. During that period, researchers plan to drive Curiosity partway up a mountain informally called Mount Sharp. Observations from orbit have identified exposures there of clay and sulfate minerals that formed in wet environments.\n",

      "</div>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>If a group of tourists piled out of a transport vehicle onto the surface of Mars, they'd no doubt start snapping pictures wildly. NASA's Curiosity rover, set to touch down on the Red Planet the evening of Aug. 5 PDT (early morning EDT), will take a more careful approach to capturing its first scenic views.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The car-size rover's very first images will come from the one-megapixel Hazard-Avoidance cameras (Hazcams) attached to the body of the rover. Once engineers have determined that it is safe to deploy the rover's Remote Sensing Mast and its high-tech cameras, a process that may take several days, Curiosity will begin to survey its exotic surroundings.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>\"A set of low-resolution gray scale Hazcam images will be acquired within minutes of landing on the surface,\" said Justin Maki of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"Once all of the critical systems have been checked out by the engineering team and the mast is deployed, the rover will image the landing site with higher-resolution cameras.\"</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Maki led the development of Curiosity's 12 engineering cameras -- eight Hazcams at the front and back of the rover, and four Navigation cameras (Navcams) at the top of the rover's \"look-out\" mast. All the engineering cameras acquire black-and-white pictures from left and right stereo \"eyes,\" which are merged to provide three-dimensional information. Half of the cameras are backups, meaning there's one set for each of the rover's A- and B-side redundant computers.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The very first images are likely to arrive more than two hours after landing, due to the timing of NASA's signal-relaying Odyssey orbiter. They will be captured with the left and right Hazcams at the back and front of the rover, and they will not yet be full-resolution (the two images arriving on Earth first are \"thumbnail\" copies, which are 64 by 64 pixels in size). The Hazcams are equipped with very wide-angle, fisheye lenses, initially capped with clear dust covers. The covers are designed to protect the cameras from dust that may be kicked up during landing; they are clear just in case they don't pop off as expected.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>These first views will give engineers a good idea of what surrounds Curiosity, as well as its location and tilt. \"Ensuring that the rover is on stable ground is important before raising the rover's mast,\" said Mission Manager Jennifer Trosper at JPL. \"We are using an entirely new landing system on this mission, so we are proceeding with caution.\"</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Color pictures from the rover's Mars Descent Imager, or MARDI, acquired as the rover descends to the Martian surface, will help pinpoint the rover's location. Initial images from MARDI are expected to be released Aug. 6, the day after landing. These will also be in the form of thumbnails (in the case of the science cameras, thumbnails can vary in size, with the largest being 192 pixels wide by 144 pixels high). One full-resolution image may also be returned at this time.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Additional color views of the planet's surface are expected the morning of Aug. 7 from the Mars Hand Lens Imager, or MAHLI, one of five devices on the rover's Inspector Gadget-like arm. The camera is designed to take close-up pictures of rocks and soil, but can also take images out to the horizon. When Curiosity lands and its arm is still stowed, the instrument will be pointed to the side, allowing it to capture an initial color view of the Gale Crater area.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Once Curiosity's mast is standing tall, the Navcams will begin taking one-megapixel stereo pictures 360 degrees around the rover as well as images of the rover deck. These cameras have medium-angle, 45-degree fields of views and could resolve the equivalent of a golf ball lying 82 feet (25 meters) away. They are designed to survey the landscape fairly quickly, and, not only can they look all around but also up and down. Navigation camera pictures are expected to begin arriving on Earth about three days after landing if the mast is deployed on schedule.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Like the Hazcams, Navcam images are used to obtain three-dimensional information about the Martian terrain. Together, they help the scientists and engineers make decisions about where and how to drive the rover and which rocks to examine with instruments that identify chemical ingredients. \"A large part of the surface mission is conducted using the images returned from the cameras,\" said Maki.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Also, about three days after landing, the narrower field-of-view Mast Cameras (Mastcams) are expected to start snapping their first shots. These two-megapixel color cameras will reveal the rover's new home in exquisite detail. Small thumbnail versions of the pictures will be sent down first with an initial high-resolution panorama expected more than a week later.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The camera of the Chemistry and Camera (ChemCam) instrument will provide a telescopic view of targets at a distance.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>As the mission progresses, the entire suite of cameras and science instruments will work together to hunt for clues to the mystery of Mars and help answer the long-standing puzzle of whether our next-door-neighbor planet has ever offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life.</p>\r\n",

      "<br /><h3>Aug. 2:  MSL Remains on Track for Weekend Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Curiosity remains in good health, with no significant issues currently in work. There are no real-time activities planned today. The Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft remains on a consistent and stable course, well within the limits required to reach its target landing ellipse. As a result, yesterday the flight team decided to cancel the build and test of a contingency version of Trajectory Correction Maneuver 5. This contingency manuever, had it been needed, would have been used in the event an emergency prevented the team from executing the nominal scheduled TCM-5 maneuver, which is planned for Friday, Aug. 3, if needed. The project also canceled a corresponding update to parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during entry, descent and landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>Aug. 1: Further Preps for Entry, Descent and Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With Curiosity now flying under the control of the autonomous entry, descent and landing timeline, the Mars Science Laboratory team continues to monitor the spacecraft's health and trajectory. There are no real-time activities planned today. In the event that a fifth trajectory correction maneuver is needed to further fine-tune the spacecraft's course to reach its target landing ellipse, the flight team is making preparations for it. If needed, that maneuver would be executed on Friday, Aug. 3. Curiosity remains in good health, with no significant issues currently in work.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 31:  Entry, Descent and Landing Timeline Activated</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The Mars Science Laboratory continues its final preparations for entry, descent and landing this upcoming weekend. Yesterday, the flight team completed and confirmed a memory test on the software for the mechanical assembly that controls MSL’s descent motor. They also configured the spacecraft for its transition to entry, descent and landing approach mode, and they enabled the spacecraft’s hardware pyrotechnic devices. MSL is now under the control of the autonomous entry, descent and landing timeline flight software. The flight team continues to monitor Curiosity's onboard systems and flight trajectory.  The spacecraft and ground systems remain in good health, with no significant issues currently being worked.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 30:  Entry, Descent and Landing Procedure Begins</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory flight team begins executing its procedure for entry, descent and landing (EDL), and the spacecraft begins its sequence of autonomous activities leading to the landing this coming weekend.  These activities include enabling needed components and setting final parameters. In addition, the schedule over the next several days includes opportunities to update parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during EDL.  If needed, these updates can fine-tune the spacecraft's autonomous controls for its descent through the atmosphere. Some parameters give the spacecraft's onboard computer knowledge about where the vehicle is relative to Mars. Others may be updated based on observations by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft of Mars' variable atmospheric conditions in this week before landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 29: Course Maneuver Successful; MSL Begins Final Approach</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Late Saturday night, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft successfully fine-tuned its course to better zero in on its target entry point into the Martian atmosphere on landing day. Two brief thruster firings totaling about six seconds altered the spacecraft's velocity slightly, by about one-fortieth of one mile per hour (one centimeter per second). This trajectory correction maneuver—the fourth since MSL's launch—adjusted the point at which Curiosity will enter the Martian atmosphere by about 13 miles (21 kilometers). On landing day, MSL can steer enough during its flight through the upper atmosphere to correct for a miss of the target entry point by a few miles and still land within its target ellipse. Mission engineers and managers rated the projected 13-mile miss big enough to warrant a correction maneuver. Telemetry and tracking data indicate the maneuver was successful. MSL will have two further opportunities for additional course corrections during the final 48 hours before landing, if needed.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 28: MSL Set to Begin Final Approach</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Tonight the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft is scheduled to perform a very small course adjustment, called Trajectory Correction Maneuver 4 (TCM-4).  Around 10 p.m. PDT (1 a.m. EDT), two brief thruster firings totaling about six seconds will adjust the spacecraft's trajectory to better hone in on Curiosity's target entry point into the Martian atmosphere. This course adjustment will be the fourth performed during MSL's journey between Earth and Mars. The maneuver will turn the spacecraft to its final attitude and mark the start of Curiosity's final approach to the Red Planet. \n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 27: MSL Telemetry Monitoring, Trajectory Tracking Continue</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The flight team continues to monitor the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft's telemetry and track its trajectory. There are no real-time spacecraft activities planned today. Late tomorrow night, the spacecraft is scheduled to perform its fourth and smallest trajectory correction maneuver, which will mark the beginning of MSL's final approach to Mars.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 26: MSL Configured for Final Approach; Flight Team Takes a Breath</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With completion of nearly all work to configure the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft for entry, descent and landing, most of the flight team is getting some well-deserved rest today in preparation for next week's final approach to Mars. There are no planned flight team spacecraft activities today. NASA's Deep Space Network continues to monitor spacecraft telemetry and track the spacecraft's trajectory.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 25: MSL's Terminal Descent Radar System Gets a Checkout</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory's terminal descent sensor is being checked out in preparation for Curiosity’s entry, descent and landing. The sensor is a radar system that is mounted on MSL's descent stage. Following separation of MSL's heat shield at an altitude of approximately 5 miles (8 kilometers) and a velocity of approximately 280 mph (125 meters per second), the sensor begins collecting data on the spacecraft's velocity and altitude in preparation for landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 24: Curiosity's Batteries Get a Charge</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, Curiosity's two lithium ion rechargeable batteries are being recharged to 100 percent of capacity in preparation for entry, descent and landing. The batteries, which have been maintained at a 70-percent state of charge during the cruise to Mars, are being recharged using power from Mars Science Laboratory's cruise-stage solar array. The batteries enable Curiosity's power subsystem to meet peak power demands of rover activities when the demand temporarily exceeds the onboard multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG) steady output level. With a capacity of about 42 amp-hours each, the batteries are expected to go through multiple charge-discharge cycles per Martian day.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 23: Prepping MSL's Descent Stage Navigation System for Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Preparations continue for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations. Today, the two inertial measurement units (IMUs) in Mars Science Laboratory's descent stage are being configured, along with other guidance and control parameters for entry, descent and landing. The IMUs are electronic devices that will be used to maneuver the spacecraft's descent stage, measuring and reporting on its velocity, orientation and gravitational forces. The descent stage does its main work during the final few minutes before touchdown on Mars, providing rocket-powered deceleration and two bands of telecommunications for the final phase of MSL's arrival at Mars that includes lowering the Curiosity rover on a bridle and continuing descent until rover touchdown.

      "<br />PASADENA, Ca. - NASA's newest Mars mission, landing in three days, will draw on support from missions sent to Mars years ago and will contribute to missions envisioned for future decades.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Curiosity is a bold step forward in learning about our neighboring planet, but this mission does not stand alone. It is part of a sustained, coordinated program of Mars exploration,\" said Doug McCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"This mission transitions the program's science emphasis from the planet's water history to its potential for past or present life.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>As the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft places the Curiosity rover on the surface of Mars next week, NASA will be using the Mars Odyssey orbiter, in service since 2001, as a relay for rapidly confirming the landing to Curiosity's flight team and the rest of the world. Earth will be below the Mars horizon from Curiosity's perspective, so the new rover will not be in direct radio contact with Earth. Two newer orbiters also will be recording Curiosity's transmissions, but that data will not be available on Earth until hours later.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When Curiosity lands beside a mountain inside a crater at about 10:31 p.m. PDT, Aug. 5 (1:31 a.m. PDT Aug. 6), the 1-ton rover's two-year prime mission on the surface of Mars will begin. However, one of the rover's 10 science instruments, the Radiation Assessment Detector, or RAD, already has logged 221 days collecting data since the spacecraft was launched on its trip to Mars on Nov. 26, 2011.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Our observations already are being used in planning for human missions,\" said Don Hassler of Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., principal investigator for Curiosity's RAD. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The instrument recorded radiation spikes from five solar flare events spewing energetic particles from the sun into interplanetary space. Radiation from galactic cosmic rays, originating from supernova explosions and other extremely distant events, accounted for more of the total radiation experienced on the trip than the amount from solar particle events. Inside the spacecraft, despite shielding roughly equivalent to what surrounds astronauts on the International Space Station, RAD recorded radiation amounting to a significant contribution to a NASA astronaut's career-limit radiation dose. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity's main assignment is to investigate whether its study area ever has offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life. To do that, it packs a science payload weighing 15 times as much as the science instruments on previous Mars rovers. The landing target, an area about 12 miles by 4 miles (20 kilometers by 7 kilometers), sits in a safely flat area between less-safe slopes of the rim of Gale Crater and the crater's central peak, informally called Mount Sharp. The target was plotted to be within driving distance of layers on Mount Sharp, where minerals that formed in water have been seen from orbit. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Some deposits right inside the landing area look as though they were deposited by water, too,\" said John Grotzinger of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, project scientist for Curiosity. \"We have a great landing site that was a strong science contender for earlier missions, but was not permitted for engineering constraints because no earlier landing could be targeted precisely enough to hit a safe area inside Gale Crater. The science team feels very optimistic about exploration of Mount Sharp and the surrounding region that includes the landing ellipse.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Mission engineers designed a sky crane maneuver, lowering Curiosity on nylon cords from a rocket backpack because the rover is too heavy to use the airbag system developed for earlier rovers. \"We know it looks crazy,\" said Adam Steltzner of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, leader of the team that developed the system. \"It really is the result of careful choices.\"  By designing the aeroshell enclosing Curiosity to create lift and be steerable, engineers were able to build a system that lands much more precisely instead of dropping like a rock.</p>\n",

      "<p><h3>Aug. 1: Further Preps for Entry, Descent and Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With Curiosity now flying under the control of the autonomous entry, descent and landing timeline, the Mars Science Laboratory team continues to monitor the spacecraft's health and trajectory. There are no real-time activities planned today. In the event that a fifth trajectory correction maneuver is needed to further fine-tune the spacecraft's course to reach its target landing ellipse, the flight team is making preparations for it. If needed, that maneuver would be executed on Friday, Aug. 3. Curiosity remains in good health, with no significant issues currently in work.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 31:  Entry, Descent and Landing Timeline Activated</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The Mars Science Laboratory continues its final preparations for entry, descent and landing this upcoming weekend. Yesterday, the flight team completed and confirmed a memory test on the software for the mechanical assembly that controls MSL’s descent motor. They also configured the spacecraft for its transition to entry, descent and landing approach mode, and they enabled the spacecraft’s hardware pyrotechnic devices. MSL is now under the control of the autonomous entry, descent and landing timeline flight software. The flight team continues to monitor Curiosity's onboard systems and flight trajectory.  The spacecraft and ground systems remain in good health, with no significant issues currently being worked.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 30:  Entry, Descent and Landing Procedure Begins</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory flight team begins executing its procedure for entry, descent and landing (EDL), and the spacecraft begins its sequence of autonomous activities leading to the landing this coming weekend.  These activities include enabling needed components and setting final parameters. In addition, the schedule over the next several days includes opportunities to update parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during EDL.  If needed, these updates can fine-tune the spacecraft's autonomous controls for its descent through the atmosphere. Some parameters give the spacecraft's onboard computer knowledge about where the vehicle is relative to Mars. Others may be updated based on observations by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft of Mars' variable atmospheric conditions in this week before landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 29: Course Maneuver Successful; MSL Begins Final Approach</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Late Saturday night, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft successfully fine-tuned its course to better zero in on its target entry point into the Martian atmosphere on landing day. Two brief thruster firings totaling about six seconds altered the spacecraft's velocity slightly, by about one-fortieth of one mile per hour (one centimeter per second). This trajectory correction maneuver—the fourth since MSL's launch—adjusted the point at which Curiosity will enter the Martian atmosphere by about 13 miles (21 kilometers). On landing day, MSL can steer enough during its flight through the upper atmosphere to correct for a miss of the target entry point by a few miles and still land within its target ellipse. Mission engineers and managers rated the projected 13-mile miss big enough to warrant a correction maneuver. Telemetry and tracking data indicate the maneuver was successful. MSL will have two further opportunities for additional course corrections during the final 48 hours before landing, if needed.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 28: MSL Set to Begin Final Approach</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Tonight the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft is scheduled to perform a very small course adjustment, called Trajectory Correction Maneuver 4 (TCM-4).  Around 10 p.m. PDT (1 a.m. EDT), two brief thruster firings totaling about six seconds will adjust the spacecraft's trajectory to better hone in on Curiosity's target entry point into the Martian atmosphere. This course adjustment will be the fourth performed during MSL's journey between Earth and Mars. The maneuver will turn the spacecraft to its final attitude and mark the start of Curiosity's final approach to the Red Planet. \n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 27: MSL Telemetry Monitoring, Trajectory Tracking Continue</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The flight team continues to monitor the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft's telemetry and track its trajectory. There are no real-time spacecraft activities planned today. Late tomorrow night, the spacecraft is scheduled to perform its fourth and smallest trajectory correction maneuver, which will mark the beginning of MSL's final approach to Mars.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 26: MSL Configured for Final Approach; Flight Team Takes a Breath</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With completion of nearly all work to configure the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft for entry, descent and landing, most of the flight team is getting some well-deserved rest today in preparation for next week's final approach to Mars. There are no planned flight team spacecraft activities today. NASA's Deep Space Network continues to monitor spacecraft telemetry and track the spacecraft's trajectory.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 25: MSL's Terminal Descent Radar System Gets a Checkout</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory's terminal descent sensor is being checked out in preparation for Curiosity’s entry, descent and landing. The sensor is a radar system that is mounted on MSL's descent stage. Following separation of MSL's heat shield at an altitude of approximately 5 miles (8 kilometers) and a velocity of approximately 280 mph (125 meters per second), the sensor begins collecting data on the spacecraft's velocity and altitude in preparation for landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 24: Curiosity's Batteries Get a Charge</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, Curiosity's two lithium ion rechargeable batteries are being recharged to 100 percent of capacity in preparation for entry, descent and landing. The batteries, which have been maintained at a 70-percent state of charge during the cruise to Mars, are being recharged using power from Mars Science Laboratory's cruise-stage solar array. The batteries enable Curiosity's power subsystem to meet peak power demands of rover activities when the demand temporarily exceeds the onboard multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG) steady output level. With a capacity of about 42 amp-hours each, the batteries are expected to go through multiple charge-discharge cycles per Martian day.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 23: Prepping MSL's Descent Stage Navigation System for Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Preparations continue for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations. Today, the two inertial measurement units (IMUs) in Mars Science Laboratory's descent stage are being configured, along with other guidance and control parameters for entry, descent and landing. The IMUs are electronic devices that will be used to maneuver the spacecraft's descent stage, measuring and reporting on its velocity, orientation and gravitational forces. The descent stage does its main work during the final few minutes before touchdown on Mars, providing rocket-powered deceleration and two bands of telecommunications for the final phase of MSL's arrival at Mars that includes lowering the Curiosity rover on a bridle and continuing descent until rover touchdown. In addition, more communications parameter updates for Curiosity's surface operations are being uploaded to Curiosity's main computers.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 22: Trajectory Tracking Continues</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Engineers at NASA's Deep Space Network continue to run differential ranging track passes to track Mars Science Laboratory's trajectory. These activities are designed to more closely track the spacecraft's trajectory and position as it draws nearer to the Red Planet and Mars' gravitational influence on the spacecraft increases.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 21: Getting a Better Bead on Trajectory</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, engineers at NASA's Deep Space Network are running two differential ranging track passes to track Mars Science Laboratory's trajectory. These activities are designed to more closely track the spacecraft's trajectory and position as it draws nearer to the Red Planet and Mars' gravitational influence on the spacecraft increases.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 20: Curiosity Completes Week of Onboard Computer Preps</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />As of yesterday evening, the week-long reboot and configuration activities on Curiosity's two redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements -- including the uplink of spacecraft configuration parameters for entry, descent and landing -- were completed, a day ahead of schedule. Today, backup software for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing is being configured onboard the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft. In case Curiosity's prime computer resets for any reason during the critical minutes of entry, descent and landing, this backup software is designed to enable Curiosity's backup computer to promptly take control and finish the landing with a bare-bones version of entry, descent and landing instructions.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 19: More Computer Preps for Curiosity</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With updated flight sequences and communications parameters for entry, descent and landing and surface operations now uploaded to one of Curiosity's two redundant main computers -- Rover Compute Element (RCE)-B -- today RCE-A is being swapped back to become Curiosity's prime computer, and RCE-B is returning to backup mode. Prime computer RCE-A will then receive its own set of updated flight sequences and communications parameters.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 18: Curiosity Continues Computer Preps, Gets 'Attitude Adjustment'</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Activities continue to prepare Curiosity's redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements, for arrival at Mars. Today, Curiosity's RCE-A computer, which was swapped with the backup computer yesterday, is being cold reset, or rebooted, while in online, or backup, mode. Work continues to upload updated flight sequences and communications parameters for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations to the spacecraft. In addition, mission controllers yesterday completed the 21st attitude control turn on the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft, a day early. This turn adjusts the spacecraft's orientation to keep its medium-gain antenna pointed toward Earth for communications. This was the second-to-last attitude control turn planned before landing day.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 17: Curiosity Swaps Computers, Gets Updated Arrival Data</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Activities continue through July 20 to prepare Curiosity’s redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements, for arrival at Mars. Today, the computer that has been operating as Curiosity’s prime computer is being swapped with the backup computer. On Wednesday July 18, that computer will be cold reset, or rebooted, while in online, or backup mode, following the same process used to cold reset the redundant computer on July 16. In addition, beginning today and continuing through July 20, updated flight sequences and communications parameters for Curiosity’s entry, descent and landing and surface operations will be uploaded to the spacecraft.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 16: Curiosity Computer Preps for Arrival</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Beginning today, Curiosity's redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements, will be power-cycled while in the online, or backup mode. The process, called a cold reset, reboots the computer, resetting it to a predictable, default state prior to the mission's arrival at Mars. This activity begins today with the reboot of the backup computer while in the online state and will continue through July 20. Tomorrow, the prime and backup computers will be swapped, and the reboot process will be repeated on Thursday with the other computer.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 13: Radiation Instrument Finishes Inflight Measurements</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The Radiation Assessment Detector instrument on Curiosity has finished the measurements it had been making during its flight from Earth to Mars. It will be configured for surface operations and turned off today and remain turned off until after landing.\n",

      "<br /><h3>July 30: Entry, Descent and Landing Procedure Begins</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory flight team begins executing its procedure for entry, descent and landing (EDL), and the spacecraft begins its sequence of autonomous activities leading to the landing this coming weekend. These activities include enabling needed components and setting final parameters. In addition, the schedule over the next several days includes opportunities to update parameters for the autonomous software controlling events during EDL. If needed, these updates can fine-tune the spacecraft's autonomous controls for its descent through the atmosphere. Some parameters give the spacecraft's onboard computer knowledge about where the vehicle is relative to Mars. Others may be updated based on observations by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft of Mars' variable atmospheric conditions in this week before landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 29: Course Maneuver Successful; MSL Begins Final Approach</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Late Saturday night, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft successfully fine-tuned its course to better zero in on its target entry point into the Martian atmosphere on landing day. Two brief thruster firings totaling about six seconds altered the spacecraft's velocity slightly, by about one-fortieth of one mile per hour (one centimeter per second). This trajectory correction maneuver the fourth since MSL's launch adjusted the point at which Curiosity will enter the Martian atmosphere by about 13 miles (21 kilometers). On landing day, MSL can steer enough during its flight through the upper atmosphere to correct for a miss of the target entry point by a few miles and still land within its target ellipse. Mission engineers and managers rated the projected 13-mile miss big enough to warrant a correction maneuver. Telemetry and tracking data indicate the maneuver was successful. MSL will have two further opportunities for additional course corrections during the final 48 hours before landing, if needed.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 28: MSL Set to Begin Final Approach</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Tonight the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft is scheduled to perform a very small course adjustment, called Trajectory Correction Maneuver 4 (TCM-4). Around 10 p.m. PDT (1 a.m. EDT), two brief thruster firings totaling about six seconds will adjust the spacecraft's trajectory to better home in on Curiosity's target entry point into the Martian atmosphere. This course adjustment will be the fourth performed during MSL's journey between Earth and Mars. The maneuver will turn the spacecraft to its final attitude and mark the start of Curiosity's final approach to the Red Planet.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 27: MSL Telemetry Monitoring, Trajectory Tracking Continue</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The flight team continues to monitor the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft's telemetry and track its trajectory. There are no real-time spacecraft activities planned today. Late tomorrow night, the spacecraft is scheduled to perform its fourth and smallest trajectory correction maneuver, which will mark the beginning of MSL's final approach to Mars.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 26: MSL Configured for Final Approach; Flight Team Takes a Breath</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With completion of nearly all work to configure the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft for entry, descent and landing, most of the flight team is getting some well-deserved rest today in preparation for next week's final approach to Mars. There are no planned flight team spacecraft activities today. NASA's Deep Space Network continues to monitor spacecraft telemetry and track the spacecraft's trajectory.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 25: MSL's Terminal Descent Radar System Gets a Checkout</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory's terminal descent sensor is being checked out in preparation for Curiosity’s entry, descent and landing. The sensor is a radar system that is mounted on MSL's descent stage. Following separation of MSL's heat shield at an altitude of approximately 5 miles (8 kilometers) and a velocity of approximately 280 mph (125 meters per second), the sensor begins collecting data on the spacecraft's velocity and altitude in preparation for landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 24: Curiosity's Batteries Get a Charge</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, Curiosity's two lithium ion rechargeable batteries are being recharged to 100 percent of capacity in preparation for entry, descent and landing. The batteries, which have been maintained at a 70-percent state of charge during the cruise to Mars, are being recharged using power from Mars Science Laboratory's cruise-stage solar array. The batteries enable Curiosity's power subsystem to meet peak power demands of rover activities when the demand temporarily exceeds the onboard multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG) steady output level. With a capacity of about 42 amp-hours each, the batteries are expected to go through multiple charge-discharge cycles per Martian day.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 23: Prepping MSL's Descent Stage Navigation System for Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Preparations continue for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations. Today, the two inertial measurement units (IMUs) in Mars Science Laboratory's descent stage are being configured, along with other guidance and control parameters for entry, descent and landing. The IMUs are electronic devices that will be used to maneuver the spacecraft's descent stage, measuring and reporting on its velocity, orientation and gravitational forces. The descent stage does its main work during the final few minutes before touchdown on Mars, providing rocket-powered deceleration and two bands of telecommunications for the final phase of MSL's arrival at Mars that includes lowering the Curiosity rover on a bridle and continuing descent until rover touchdown. In addition, more communications parameter updates for Curiosity's surface operations are being uploaded to Curiosity's main computers.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 22: Trajectory Tracking Continues</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Engineers at NASA's Deep Space Network continue to run differential ranging track passes to track Mars Science Laboratory's trajectory. These activities are designed to more closely track the spacecraft's trajectory and position as it draws nearer to the Red Planet and Mars' gravitational influence on the spacecraft increases.\n",

      "<br />As of yesterday evening, the week-long reboot and configuration activities on Curiosity's two redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements -- including the uplink of spacecraft configuration parameters for entry, descent and landing -- were completed, a day ahead of schedule. Today, backup software for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing is being configured onboard the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft.

      "<br />With updated flight sequences and communications parameters for entry, descent and landing and surface operations now uploaded to one of Curiosity's two redundant main computers -- Rover Compute Element (RCE)-B -- today RCE-A is being swapped back to become Curiosity's prime computer, and RCE-B is returning to backup mode. Prime computer RCE-A will then receive its own set of updated flight sequences and communications parameters.\n",

      "<p>Go outside after sunset on August 5th and look west where the setting sun has just disappeared. As soon as the sky fades to black, a triangle of first-magnitude lights will pop out of the twilight. The vertices are Mars, Saturn, and Spica.

      "<br /><h3>July 29: Course Maneuver Successful; MSL Begins Final Approach</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Late Saturday night, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft successfully fine-tuned its course to better zero in on its target entry point into the Martian atmosphere on landing day. Two brief thruster firings totaling about six seconds altered the spacecraft's velocity slightly, by about one-fortieth of one mile per hour (one centimeter per second). This trajectory correction maneuver the fourth since MSL's launch adjusted the point at which Curiosity will enter the Martian atmosphere by about 13 miles (21 kilometers). On landing day, MSL can steer enough during its flight through the upper atmosphere to correct for a miss of the target entry point by a few miles and still land within its target ellipse. Mission engineers and managers rated the projected 13-mile miss big enough to warrant a correction maneuver. Telemetry and tracking data indicate the maneuver was successful. MSL will have two further opportunities for additional course corrections during the final 48 hours before landing, if needed.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 28: MSL Set to Begin Final Approach</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Tonight the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft is scheduled to perform a very small course adjustment, called Trajectory Correction Maneuver 4 (TCM-4). Around 10 p.m. PDT (1 a.m. EDT), two brief thruster firings totaling about six seconds will adjust the spacecraft's trajectory to better home in on Curiosity's target entry point into the Martian atmosphere. This course adjustment will be the fourth performed during MSL's journey between Earth and Mars. The maneuver will turn the spacecraft to its final attitude and mark the start of Curiosity's final approach to the Red Planet.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 27: MSL Telemetry Monitoring, Trajectory Tracking Continue</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The flight team continues to monitor the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft's telemetry and track its trajectory. There are no real-time spacecraft activities planned today. Late tomorrow night, the spacecraft is scheduled to perform its fourth and smallest trajectory correction maneuver, which will mark the beginning of MSL's final approach to Mars.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 26: MSL Configured for Final Approach; Flight Team Takes a Breath</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With completion of nearly all work to configure the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft for entry, descent and landing, most of the flight team is getting some well-deserved rest today in preparation for next week's final approach to Mars. There are no planned flight team spacecraft activities today. NASA's Deep Space Network continues to monitor spacecraft telemetry and track the spacecraft's trajectory.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 25: MSL's Terminal Descent Radar System Gets a Checkout</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory's terminal descent sensor is being checked out in preparation for Curiosity’s entry, descent and landing. The sensor is a radar system that is mounted on MSL's descent stage. Following separation of MSL's heat shield at an altitude of approximately 5 miles (8 kilometers) and a velocity of approximately 280 mph (125 meters per second), the sensor begins collecting data on the spacecraft's velocity and altitude in preparation for landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 24: Curiosity's Batteries Get a Charge</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, Curiosity's two lithium ion rechargeable batteries are being recharged to 100 percent of capacity in preparation for entry, descent and landing. The batteries, which have been maintained at a 70-percent state of charge during the cruise to Mars, are being recharged using power from Mars Science Laboratory's cruise-stage solar array. The batteries enable Curiosity's power subsystem to meet peak power demands of rover activities when the demand temporarily exceeds the onboard multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG) steady output level. With a capacity of about 42 amp-hours each, the batteries are expected to go through multiple charge-discharge cycles per Martian day.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 23: Prepping MSL's Descent Stage Navigation System for Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Preparations continue for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations. Today, the two inertial measurement units (IMUs) in Mars Science Laboratory's descent stage are being configured, along with other guidance and control parameters for entry, descent and landing. The IMUs are electronic devices that will be used to maneuver the spacecraft's descent stage, measuring and reporting on its velocity, orientation and gravitational forces. The descent stage does its main work during the final few minutes before touchdown on Mars, providing rocket-powered deceleration and two bands of telecommunications for the final phase of MSL's arrival at Mars that includes lowering the Curiosity rover on a bridle and continuing descent until rover touchdown. In addition, more communications parameter updates for Curiosity's surface operations are being uploaded to Curiosity's main computers.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 22: Trajectory Tracking Continues</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Engineers at NASA's Deep Space Network continue to run differential ranging track passes to track Mars Science Laboratory's trajectory. These activities are designed to more closely track the spacecraft's trajectory and position as it draws nearer to the Red Planet and Mars' gravitational influence on the spacecraft increases.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 21: Getting a Better Bead on Trajectory</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, engineers at NASA's Deep Space Network are running two differential ranging track passes to track Mars Science Laboratory's trajectory. These activities are designed to more closely track the spacecraft's trajectory and position as it draws nearer to the Red Planet and Mars' gravitational influence on the spacecraft increases.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 20: Curiosity Completes Week of Onboard Computer Preps</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />As of yesterday evening, the week-long reboot and configuration activities on Curiosity's two redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements -- including the uplink of spacecraft configuration parameters for entry, descent and landing -- were completed, a day ahead of schedule. Today, backup software for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing is being configured onboard the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft. In case Curiosity's prime computer resets for any reason during the critical minutes of entry, descent and landing, this backup software is designed to enable Curiosity's backup computer to promptly take control and finish the landing with a bare-bones version of entry, descent and landing instructions.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 19: More Computer Preps for Curiosity</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />With updated flight sequences and communications parameters for entry, descent and landing and surface operations now uploaded to one of Curiosity's two redundant main computers -- Rover Compute Element (RCE)-B -- today RCE-A is being swapped back to become Curiosity's prime computer, and RCE-B is returning to backup mode. Prime computer RCE-A will then receive its own set of updated flight sequences and communications parameters.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 18: Curiosity Continues Computer Preps, Gets 'Attitude Adjustment'</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Activities continue to prepare Curiosity's redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements, for arrival at Mars. Today, Curiosity's RCE-A computer, which was swapped with the backup computer yesterday, is being cold reset, or rebooted, while in online, or backup, mode. Work continues to upload updated flight sequences and communications parameters for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations to the spacecraft. In addition, mission controllers yesterday completed the 21st attitude control turn on the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft, a day early. This turn adjusts the spacecraft's orientation to keep its medium-gain antenna pointed toward Earth for communications. This was the second-to-last attitude control turn planned before landing day.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 17: Curiosity Swaps Computers, Gets Updated Arrival Data</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Activities continue through July 20 to prepare Curiosity’s redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements, for arrival at Mars. Today, the computer that has been operating as Curiosity’s prime computer is being swapped with the backup computer. On Wednesday July 18, that computer will be cold reset, or rebooted, while in online, or backup mode, following the same process used to cold reset the redundant computer on July 16. In addition, beginning today and continuing through July 20, updated flight sequences and communications parameters for Curiosity’s entry, descent and landing and surface operations will be uploaded to the spacecraft.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 16: Curiosity Computer Preps for Arrival</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Beginning today, Curiosity's redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements, will be power-cycled while in the online, or backup mode. The process, called a cold reset, reboots the computer, resetting it to a predictable, default state prior to the mission's arrival at Mars. This activity begins today with the reboot of the backup computer while in the online state and will continue through July 20. Tomorrow, the prime and backup computers will be swapped, and the reboot process will be repeated on Thursday with the other computer.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 13: Radiation Instrument Finishes Inflight Measurements</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The Radiation Assessment Detector instrument on Curiosity has finished the measurements it had been making during its flight from Earth to Mars. It will be configured for surface operations and turned off today and remain turned off until after landing.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 12: MSL Team Has Final Test of Landing Procedures</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Today, the Mars Science Laboratory flight team is conducting a final operations readiness test of entry, descent and landing procedures in preparation for Curiosity's landing on Aug. 5, PDT.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 11: MSL Complete Turn</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />The Mars Science Laboratory Spacecraft completed an attitude control turn today, adjusting its orientation for keeping its medium-gain antenna pointed toward Earth for communications. This was the third-to-last attitude control turn planned before landing day.</p>\n",

      "<br />PASADENA, Calif. -- Eight days before reaching Mars, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft performed a flight-path adjustment scheduled more than nine months ago.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />The trajectory correction maneuver completed late Saturday may be the last one the mission needs before landing day, though two further opportunities remain on its schedule in case they are needed.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />The spacecraft is on course for delivering the mission's car-size rover, Curiosity, to a landing target beside a Martian mountain at about 10:31 p.m. PDT on Aug. 5. (1:31 a.m. on Aug. 6, EDT). After landing, the rover will spend a two-year prime mission studying whether the area has ever offered environmental conditions favorable for life.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />The spacecraft used two brief thruster firings totaling about 6 seconds to adjust its trajectory at about 10 p.m. PDT on July 28 (1 a.m. on July 29, EDT). This maneuver had been on the mission's schedule since before launch on Nov. 26, 2011. It altered the flight path less than any of the spacecraft's three previous trajectory correction maneuvers on the way from Earth to Mars.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />The Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft had been on a course in recent weeks that would have hit a point at the top of the Martian atmosphere about 13 miles (21 kilometers) east of the target entry point. On landing day, it can steer enough during its flight through the upper atmosphere to correct for missing the target entry point by a few miles and still land on the intended patch of Mars real estate. The mission's engineers and managers rated the projected 13-mile miss big enough to warrant a correction maneuver.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />\"The purpose of this maneuver is to move the point at which Curiosity enters the atmosphere by about 13 miles,\" said Tomas Martin-Mur of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., chief of the mission's navigation team. \"The first look at telemetry and tracking data afterwards indicates the maneuver succeeded as planned.\"\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />The thruster firings altered the spacecraft's velocity by about one-fortieth of one mile per hour (one centimeter per second). Curiosity will enter Mars' atmosphere at a speed of about 13,200 mph (5,900 meters per second).\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />Opportunities for two further course corrections are scheduled in the final 48 hours before landing, if needed.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />\"I will not be surprised if this was our last trajectory correction maneuver,\" Martin Mur said of Saturday's event. \"We will be monitoring the trajectory using the antennas of the Deep Space Network to be sure Curiosity is staying on the right path for a successful entry, descent and landing.\"\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />Descent from the top of Mars' atmosphere to the surface will employ bold techniques enabling use of a smaller target area and heavier landed payload than were possible for any previous Mars mission. These innovations, if successful, will place a well-equipped mobile laboratory into a locale especially well-suited for its mission of discovery. The same innovations advance NASA toward capabilities needed for human missions to Mars.\n",
      "<br /><br>\n",
      "<br />As of July 30, the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft carrying the rover Curiosity will have traveled about 343 million miles (555 million kilometers) of its 352-million-mile (567-million-kilometer) flight to Mars.\n",

The batteries enable Curiosity's power subsystem to meet peak power demands of rover activities when the demand temporarily exceeds the onboard multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG) steady output level. With a capacity of about 42 amp-hours each, the batteries are expected to go through multiple charge-discharge cycles per Martian day.\n",

      "<br />Preparations continue for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations. Today, the two inertial measurement units (IMUs) in Mars Science Laboratory's descent stage are being configured, along with other guidance and control parameters for entry, descent and landing. The IMUs are electronic devices that will be used to maneuver the spacecraft's descent stage, measuring and reporting on its velocity, orientation and gravitational forces. The descent stage does its main work during the final few minutes before touchdown on Mars, providing rocket-powered deceleration and two bands of telecommunications for the final phase of MSL's arrival at Mars that includes lowering the Curiosity rover on a bridle and continuing descent until rover touchdown. In addition, more communications parameter updates for Curiosity's surface operations are being uploaded to Curiosity's main computers.\n",

      "<br />PASADENA, Calif. -- NASA's Mars Odyssey spacecraft has successfully adjusted its orbital location to be in a better position to provide prompt confirmation of the August landing of the Curiosity rover.<br />\n",
      "<br />NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft carrying Curiosity can send limited information directly to Earth as it enters Mars' atmosphere. Before the landing, Earth will set below the Martian horizon from the descending spacecraft's perspective, ending that direct route of communication. Odyssey will help to speed up the indirect communication process.<br />\n",
      "<br />NASA reported during a July 16 news conference that Odyssey, which originally was planned to provide a near-real-time communication link with Curiosity, had entered safe mode July 11. This situation would have affected communication operations, but not the rover's landing. Without a repositioning maneuver, Odyssey would have arrived over the landing area about two minutes after Curiosity landed.<br />\n",
      "<br />A spacecraft thruster burn Tuesday, July 24, lasting about six seconds has nudged Odyssey about six minutes ahead in its orbit. Odyssey is now operating normally, and confirmation of Curiosity's landing is expected to reach Earth at about 10:31 p.m. PDT on Aug. 5 (early Aug. 6, EDT and Universal Time), as originally planned.<br />\n",
      "<br />\"Information we are receiving indicates the maneuver has completed as planned,\" said Mars Odyssey Project Manager Gaylon McSmith of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"Odyssey has been working at Mars longer than any other spacecraft, so it is appropriate that it has a special role in supporting the newest arrival.\"<br />\n",
      "<br />Two other Mars orbiters, NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the European Space Agency's Mars Express, also will be in position to receive radio transmissions from the Mars Science Laboratory during its descent. However, they will be recording information for later playback, not relaying it immediately, as only Odyssey can.<br />\n",
      "<br />Odyssey arrived at Mars in 2001. Besides conducting its own scientific observations, it has served as a communication relay for NASA's Spirit and Opportunity Mars rovers and the Phoenix lander on the Martian surface. NASA plans to use Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter as communication relays for Curiosity during that rover's two-year prime mission on Mars.<br />\n",

      "<br /><h3>July 23: Prepping MSL's Descent Stage Navigation System for Landing</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Preparations continue for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations. Today, the two inertial measurement units (IMUs) in Mars Science Laboratory's descent stage are being configured, along with other guidance and control parameters for entry, descent and landing. The IMUs are electronic devices that will be used to maneuver the spacecraft's descent stage, measuring and reporting on its velocity, orientation and gravitational forces. The descent stage does its main work during the final few minutes before touchdown on Mars, providing rocket-powered deceleration and two bands of telecommunications for the final phase of MSL's arrival at Mars that includes lowering the Curiosity rover on a bridle and continuing descent until rover touchdown. In addition, more communications parameter updates for Curiosity's surface operations are being uploaded to Curiosity's main computers.<br><br>\n",
      "<br /><h3>July 22: Trajectory Tracking Continues</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />Engineers at NASA's Deep Space Network continue to run differential ranging track passes to track Mars Science Laboratory's trajectory. These activities are designed to more closely track the spacecraft's trajectory and position as it draws nearer to the Red Planet and Mars' gravitational influence on the spacecraft increases.<br><br>\n",

      "<br /><h3>July 20: Curiosity Completes Week of Onboard Computer Preps</h3><br>\n",
      "<br />As of yesterday evening, the week-long reboot and configuration activities on Curiosity's two redundant main computers, or Rover Compute Elements -- including the uplink of spacecraft configuration parameters for entry, descent and landing -- were completed, a day ahead of schedule. Today, backup software for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing is being configured onboard the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft. In case Curiosity's prime computer resets for any reason during the critical minutes of entry, descent and landing, this backup software is designed to enable Curiosity's backup computer to promptly take control and finish the landing with a bare-bones version of entry, descent and landing instructions.<br><br>\n",

Work continues to upload updated flight sequences and communications parameters for Curiosity's entry, descent and landing and surface operations to the spacecraft. In addition, mission controllers yesterday completed the 21st attitude control turn on the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft, a day early. This turn adjusts the spacecraft's orientation to keep its medium-gain antenna pointed toward Earth for communications. This was the second-to-last attitude control turn planned before landing day.<br><br>\n",

      "</div>PASADENA, Calif. -- NASA's most advanced planetary rover is on a precise course for an early August landing beside a Martian mountain to begin two years of unprecedented scientific detective work. However, getting the Curiosity rover to the surface of Mars will not be easy. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The Curiosity landing is the hardest NASA mission ever attempted in the history of robotic planetary exploration,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"While the challenge is great, the team's skill and determination give me high confidence in a successful landing.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Mars Science Laboratory mission is a precursor for future human missions to Mars. President Obama has set a challenge to reach the Red Planet in the 2030s. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>To achieve the precision needed for landing safely inside Gale Crater, the spacecraft will fly like a wing in the upper atmosphere instead of dropping like a rock. To land the 1-ton rover, an airbag method used on previous Mars rovers will not work. Mission engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., designed a \"sky crane\" method for the final several seconds of the flight. A backpack with retro-rockets controlling descent speed will lower the rover on three nylon cords just before touchdown. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>During a critical period lasting only about seven minutes, the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft carrying Curiosity must decelerate from about 13,200 mph (about 5,900 meters per second) to allow the rover to land on the surface at about 1.7 mph (three-fourths of a meter per second). Curiosity is scheduled to land at approximately 10:31 p.m. PDT on Aug. 5 (1:31 a.m. EDT on Aug. 6). </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Those seven minutes are the most challenging part of this entire mission,\" said Pete Theisinger, the mission's project manager at JPL. \"For the landing to succeed, hundreds of events will need to go right, many with split-second timing and all controlled autonomously by the spacecraft. We've done all we can think of to succeed. We expect to get Curiosity safely onto the ground, but there is no guarantee. The risks are real.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>During the initial weeks after the actual landing, JPL mission controllers will put the rover through a series of checkouts and activities to characterize its performance on Mars, while gradually ramping up scientific investigations. Curiosity then will begin investigating whether an area with a wet history inside Mars' Gale Crater ever has offered an environment favorable for microbial life.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Earlier missions have found that ancient Mars had wet environments,\" said Michael Meyer, lead scientist for NASA's Mars Program at NASA Headquarters. \"Curiosity takes us the next logical step in understanding the potential for life on Mars.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity will use tools on a robotic arm to deliver samples from Martian rocks and soils into laboratory instruments inside the rover that can reveal chemical and mineral composition. A laser instrument will use its beam to induce a spark on a target and read the spark's spectrum of light to identify chemical elements in the target. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Other instruments on the car-sized rover will examine the surrounding environment from a distance or by direct touch with the arm. The rover will check for the basic chemical ingredients for life and for evidence about energy available for life. It also will assess factors that could be hazardous for life, such as the radiation environment.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"For its ambitious goals, this mission needs a great landing site and a big payload,\" said Doug McCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters. \"During the descent through the atmosphere, the mission will rely on bold techniques enabling use of a smaller target area and a heavier robot on the ground than were possible for any previous Mars mission. Those techniques also advance us toward human-crew Mars missions, which will need even more precise targeting and heavier landers.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The chosen landing site is beside a mountain informally called Mount Sharp. The mission's prime destination lies on the slope of the mountain. Driving there from the landing site may take many months. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Be patient about the drive. It will be well worth the wait and we are apt to find some targets of interest on the way,\" said John Grotzinger, MSL project scientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \"When we get to the lower layers in Mount Sharp, we'll read them like chapters in a book about changing environmental conditions when Mars was wetter than it is today.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In collaboration with Microsoft Corp., a new outreach game was unveiled Monday to give the public a sense of the challenge and adventure of landing in a precise location on the surface.

      "<br />The orbiter put itself in the precautionary, Earth-pointed status called safe mode, at about 1 p.m. PDT (4 p.m. EDT) on July 11, as it finished a maneuver adjusting, or trimming, its orbit. Odyssey's computer did not reboot, so diagnostic information was subsequently available from the spacecraft's onboard memory. Based on analysis of that information, the mission's controllers sent commands yesterday morning taking Odyssey out of safe mode and reorienting it to point downward at Mars.<br />\n",
      "<br />\"We are on a cautious path to resume Odyssey's science and relay operations soon,\" said Gaylon McSmith, Odyssey project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"We will also be assessing whether another orbit trim maneuver is warranted.\"<br />\n",
      "<br />The thruster burn for Wednesday's orbit-trim maneuver lasted 1.5 seconds, as planned, which was shorter than any previous orbit-trim maneuver of the mission's decade at Mars. The spacecraft's onboard capability for maintaining orientation during the burn put unexpectedly high demand on a reaction wheel in the attitude control system, which prompted the change to safe mode.<br />\n",
      "<br />NASA launched the Mars Odyssey spacecraft on April 7, 2001, and it arrived at Mars Oct. 24, 2001. It has worked at Mars longer than any other Mars mission in history. Besides conducting its own scientific observations, it serves as a communication relay for robots on the Martian surface. NASA plans to use Odyssey and the newer Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter as communication relays for the Mars Science Laboratory mission during the landing and Mars-surface operations of its Curiosity rover.<br />\n",
      "<br />Odyssey is managed by JPL for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver built the spacecraft. JPL and Lockheed Martin collaborate on operating the spacecraft.

      "</div>One month and a day after celebrating its independence with fireworks exhibitions throughout the country, America will carry its penchant for awe-inspiring aerial pyrotechnic displays to the skies of another world. Some pyrotechnics will be as small as the energy released by a box of matches. One packs the same oomph as a stick of TNT.  Whether they be large or small, on the evening of August 5th (Pacific time), all 76 must work on cue as NASA's next Mars rover, Curiosity, carried by the Mars Science Laboratory, streaks through the Red Planet's atmosphere on its way to a landing at Gale Crater. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We are definitely coming in with a bang - or a series of them,\" said Pete Theisinger, Mars Science Laboratory project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.  \"You only get one shot at a Mars landing, and the pyrotechnic charges we are using are great for reliably providing instantaneous, irreversible actions like deploying a parachute or opening a fuel valve.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Explosive pyrotechnic devices predate the space age by about a thousand years.  Around 750 A.D., people in China began stuffing an early form of gunpowder into bamboo shoots and throwing them into a fire.  At some point, someone interested in taking this new discovery to the next level (probably also from that region), decided aerial explosions would be even cooler, and the \"aerial salute\" was born.  Fireworks were also part of America's very first Independence Day in 1777. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Pyrotechnics, or pyromechanical devices, are a natural but highly-engineered extension of these early fireworks. Instead of a rocket's red glare and bombs bursting in air, the energy from these explosions is contained within a mechanism, where it is used to move, cut, pull or separate something. Controlled explosions are a valuable tool to those who explore beyond Earth's atmosphere because they are quick and reliable. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"When we need valves to open, or things to move or come apart, we want to be confident they will do so within milliseconds of the time we plan for them to do so,\" said Rich Webster, a pyromechanical engineer at JPL.  \"With pyros, no electrical motors need to move. No latches need to be unlatched. We blow things apart -- scientifically.\"\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />Seventeen minutes before landing, the first 10 of 76 pyros will fire within five milliseconds of each other, releasing the cruise stage that provided the entry capsule (and its cocooned descent vehicle and the Curiosity rover) with power, communications and thermal control support during its 254-day journey to Mars. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We have essentially three miniature guillotines onboard that, when the pyros fire, cut cabling and metal tubing that run between the cruise stage and the entry capsule,\" said Luke Dubord, avionics engineer for Mars Science Laboratory at JPL.  \"Then a retraction pyro pulls them out of the way. Along with that, we've got six pyrotechnic separation nuts, which when fired, will actually accomplish the separation.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>One hundred and twenty-five milliseconds later, two more pyros fire, releasing compressed springs that jettison two 165-pounds(75-kilogram) solid tungsten weights. These weights allow the entry capsule to perform history's first planetary lifting body entry (see  <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/technology/insituexploration/edl/guidedentry/\">http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/technology/insituexploration/edl/guidedentry/</a> ).  A dozen minutes and one fiery, lifting-body atmospheric reentry later, another smaller set of tungsten weights is ejected by pyros to re-adjust the lander's center of mass for the final approach to the surface. A few seconds after that, the largest bang since the spacecraft separated from its Atlas rocket 254 days before is scheduled to occur.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The Mars Science Lab parachute is the largest used on a planetary mission,\" said Dubord. \"When folded up and in its canister, it's still as big as a trashcan. We have to get that folded-up chute out of its canister and unfolding in a hurry. The best way to do that is get it quickly away from spacecraft and out into the freestream using a mortar.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The best way to do that, the engineers at JPL decided, was to include a pyrotechnic charge equivalent to a stick of TNT.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"When something like this goes off, it makes a lot of noise\" said Dubord. \"Of course, at 8.7 miles [14 kilometers] up and a little over Mach 1, over Mars, I doubt anybody will be there to hear it.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>While the ejection of the parachute is the biggest pyrotechnic display during the crucial entry, descent and landing, it is certainly not the last.  The landing system needs to be released from the backshell that helped protect it during entry. The sky crane's descent engines need to be pressurized, and the rover itself needs to be released from the sky crane, where it is lowered on tethers toward the surface. All told, there are another 44 controlled explosions that need to happen at exactly the right time and at absolutely no other time for Curiosity to touch down safely at Gale Crater.  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Excluding the parachute mortar, the total 'explosive' material in all the pyrotechnics aboard the spacecraft is only about 50 to 60 grams,\" said Webster. \"That is about the same amount of combustible material in the air bag in your car's steering wheel.  When you do the math, the amount of explosive material in each pyrotechnic is only about what you would get out of a pack of matches.\n",

      "<p>The latest trajectory correction maneuver, the third and smallest since the Nov. 26, 2011, launch, used four thruster firings totaling just 40 seconds. Spacecraft data and Doppler-effect changes in radio signal from the craft indicate the maneuver succeeded. As designed by engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., the maneuver adjusts the location where the spacecraft will enter Mars' atmosphere by about 125 miles (200 kilometers) and advances the time of entry by about 70 seconds.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>The maneuver served both to correct errors in the flight path that remained after earlier correction maneuvers and to carry out a decision this month to shift the landing target about 4 miles (7 kilometers) closer to the mountain. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>It altered the spacecraft's velocity by about one-tenth of a mile per hour (50 millimeters per second). The flight's first and second trajectory correction maneuvers produced velocity changes about 150 times larger on Jan. 11 and about 20 times larger on March 26.</p>\n",

      "<p>After more than 11 years of non-operational storage, the spare reaction wheel passed preliminary tests on Wednesday, June 12, spinning at up to 5,000 rotations per minute forward and backward.

After arrival, the spacecraft spent several months using a technique called aerobraking, which involved dipping into the Martian atmosphere to adjust its orbit. In February 2002, science operations began. Odyssey has worked at Mars longer than any other mission in history.  Besides conducting its own scientific observations, it serves as a communication relay for robots on the surface of Mars.

      "<p>PASADENA, Calif. -- With its daily supply of solar energy increasing, NASA's durable Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity has driven off the sunward-tilted outcrop, called Greeley Haven, where it worked during its fifth Martian winter.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Opportunity's first drive since Dec. 26, 2011, took the rover about 12 feet (3.67 meters) northwest and downhill on Tuesday, May 8. The rover operations team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., received confirmation of the completed drive late Tuesday, relayed from NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter.  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We're off the Greeley Haven outcrop onto the sand just below it,\" said rover driver Ashley Stroupe of JPL. \"It feels good to be on the move again.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>While at Greeley Haven for the past 19 weeks, Opportunity used the spectrometers and microscopic imager on its robotic arm to inspect more than a dozen targets within reach on the outcrop. Radio Doppler signals from the stationary rover during the winter months served an investigation of the interior of Mars by providing precise information about the planet's rotation.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Opportunity will look back with its panoramic camera to acquire multi-filter imaging of the surface targets it studied on Greeley Haven. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The rover team will also check that the power supply still looks sufficient with the rover at a reduced tilt. Opportunity kept a northward tilt of about 15 degrees in recent months at its winter haven. In Mars' southern hemisphere, that tilt kept its solar panels favorably angled toward the winter sun low in the northern sky. The winter solstice for southern Mars was at the end of March. The northward tilt after Tuesday's drive is about 8 degrees.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Opportunity has been exploring the Meridiani region of Mars since landing in January 2004. It arrived at the Cape York section of the rim of Endeavour Crater in August 2011, and has been studying rock and soil targets on Cape York since then.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Our next goal is a few meters farther north on Cape York, at a bright-looking patch of what may be dust,\" said Opportunity science-team member Matt Golombek of JPL. \"We haven't been able to see much dust in Meridiani. This could be a chance to learn more about it.\"  Beyond the dust patch, the team intends to use Opportunity to study veins in bedrock around the northern edge of Cape York. A vein inspected before winter contained gypsum deposited long ago by mineral-laden water flowing through a crack in the rock. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Endeavour Crater offers Opportunity a setting for plenty of productive work. The crater is 14 miles (22 kilometers) in diameter -- more than 20 times wider than Victoria Crater, which Opportunity examined for two years. One type of deposit detected from orbit at some locations on Endeavour's rim contains ancient clay minerals, interpreted as evidence of ancient, wet conditions with less acidity than the ancient, wet environments recorded at sites Opportunity visited during its first seven years on Mars.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Unless wind removes some dust from Opportunity's solar array, allowing more sunlight to reach the solar cells, the rover will need to work during the next few weeks at locations with no southward slope. \"We'll head south as soon as power levels are adequate to handle the slopes where we'll go,\" said Mars Exploration Rover Deputy Project Scientist Diana Blaney of JPL. \"There are some deposits on Cape York where, based on their geologic setting, we think there's a good chance of finding ancient clays.\"  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A later destination for Opportunity lies farther south, on a rim segment named Cape Tribulation, where ancient clays have been detected from orbit. </p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>For years, researchers debated whether sand dunes observed on Mars were mostly fossil features related to past climate, rather than currently active. In the past two years, researchers using images from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera have detected and reported sand movement.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Now, scientists using HiRISE images have determined that entire dunes as thick as 200 feet (61 meters) are moving as coherent units across the Martian landscape. The study was published online today by the journal Nature.</p>\n",

      "<p>\"We chose Nili Patera because we knew there was sand motion going on there, and we could quantify it,\" said Nathan Bridges, a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., and lead author of the Nature paper. \"The Nili dunes also are similar to dunes in places like Antarctica and to other locations on Mars.\"</p>\n",

Using the new information about the volume of sand that is moving, scientists estimate rocks in Nili Patera would be worn away at about the same pace as rocks near sand dunes in Antarctica, where similar sand fluxes occur.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Our new data shows wind activity is indeed a major agent of evolution of the landscape on Mars,\" said Jean-Philippe Avouac, Caltech team leader. \"This is important because it tells us something about the current state of Mars and how the planet is working today, geologically.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Scientists calculate that if someone stood in the Nili Patera dunes and measured out a one-yard (one-meter) width, they would see more than two cubic yards (1,500 liters) of sand pass by in an Earth year, about as much as in a child's sand box. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"No one had estimates of this flux before,\" said Bridges. \"We had seen with HiRISE that there was dune motion, but it was an open question how much sand could be moving. Now, we can answer that.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Scientists will use the information to understand broader mysteries on Mars, like why so much of the surface appears heavily eroded, how that occurred, and whether it is a current process or it was done in the past.

It reached Endeavour last summer, three years after the rover's science team chose Endeavour as a long-term destination. This crater is about 4 billion years old and 14 miles (22 kilometers) in diameter. </p>\n",

      "<p>The impact that excavated the crater left a jumble of fused-together rock fragments around the rim. In a chunk brought to the surface by a later, much smaller impact into the rim, Opportunity found evidence that the original impact released heated, underground water that deposited zinc in that rock. Later after the impact, cool water flowed through cracks in the ground near the edge of the crater and deposited veins of the mineral gypsum. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"These bright mineral veins are different from anything seen previously on Mars, and they tell a clear story of water flowing through cracks in the rocks,\" said Steve Squyres of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y. He is the principal investigator for Opportunity and lead author of the new report by 27 researchers. \"From landing until just before reaching the Endeavour rim, Opportunity was driving over sandstone made of sulfate grains that had been deposited by water and later blown around by the wind. These gypsum veins tell us about water that flowed through the rocks at this exact spot. It's the strongest evidence for water that we've ever seen with Opportunity.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>For the past four months, the solar-powered rover has been working at one outcrop on the Endeavour rim, called Greeley Haven. Reduced daylight during the Martian winter, and accumulated dust on the rover's solar array, have kept energy too low for driving. \n",
      "<br />\"The days are now growing longer, and the sun is moving higher in the sky at Endeavour Crater. We expect Opportunity to resume driving in the next two months and continue exploring other parts of the crater's rim,\" said Mars Exploration Rover Project Manager John Callas of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.</p>\n",

      "<p>\"Exploring Endeavour Crater is like having a new landing site,\" said JPL's Timothy Parker, a co-author of the new report. \"That's not just because of the difference in the geology here compared to what we saw during most of the first eight years, but also because there's a whole vista before us inviting much more exploration.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>Opportunity and its rover twin, Spirit, completed their three-month prime missions on Mars in April 2004. Both rovers continued for years of bonus, extended missions.

      "<p>Opportunity reached a multi-year driving destination, Endeavour Crater, in August 2011. At Endeavour's rim, it has gained access to geological deposits from an earlier period of Martian history than anything it examined during its first seven years. It also has begun an investigation of the planet's deep interior that takes advantage of staying in one place for the Martian winter.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Opportunity landed in Eagle Crater on Mars on Jan. 25, 2004, Universal Time and EST (Jan. 24, PST), three weeks after its rover twin, Spirit, landed halfway around the planet. In backyard-size Eagle Crater, Opportunity found evidence of an ancient wet environment. The mission met all its goals within the originally planned span of three months. During most of the next four years, it explored successively larger and deeper craters, adding evidence about wet and dry periods from the same era as the Eagle Crater deposits.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In mid-2008, researchers drove Opportunity out of Victoria Crater, half a mile (800 meters) in diameter, and set course for Endeavour Crater, 14 miles (22 kilometers) in diameter.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Endeavour is a window further into Mars' past,\" said Mars Exploration Rover Program Manager John Callas, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The trek took three years. In a push to finish it, Opportunity drove farther during its eighth year on Mars -- 4.8 miles (7.7 kilometers) -- than in any prior year, bringing its total driving distance to 21.4 miles (34.4 kilometers).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The \"Cape York\" segment of Endeavour's rim, where Opportunity has been working since August 2011, has already validated the choice of Endeavour as a long-term goal.  \"It's like starting a new mission, and we hit pay dirt right out of the gate,\" Callas said. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The first outcrop that Opportunity examined on Cape York differs from any the rover had seen previously. Its high zinc content suggests effects of water. Weeks later, at the edge of Cape York, a bright mineral vein identified as hydrated calcium sulfate provided what the mission's principal investigator, Steve Squyres of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., calls \"the clearest evidence for liquid water on Mars that we have found in our eight years on the planet.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Mars years last nearly twice as long as Earth years. Entering its ninth Earth year on Mars, Opportunity is also heading into its fifth Martian winter. Its solar panels have accumulated so much dust since Martian winds last cleaned them -- more than in previous winters -- the rover needs to stay on a sun-facing slope to have enough energy to keep active through the winter. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The rover team has not had to use this strategy with Opportunity in past winters, though it did so with Spirit, farther from the equator, for the three Martian winters that Spirit survived. By the beginning of the rovers' fourth Martian winter, drive motors in two of Spirit's six wheels had ceased working, long past their design lifespan. The impaired mobility kept the rover from maneuvering to an energy-favorable slope. Spirit stopped communicating in March 2010.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>All six of Opportunity's wheels are still useful for driving, but the rover will stay on an outcrop called \"Greeley Haven\" until mid-2012 to take advantage of the outcrop's favorable slope and targets of scientific interest during the Martian winter. After the winter, or earlier if wind cleans dust off the solar panels, researchers plan to drive Opportunity in search of clay minerals that a Mars orbiter's observations indicate lie on Endeavour's rim.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The top priority at Greeley Haven is the radio-science campaign to provide information about Mars' interior,\" said JPL's Diana Blaney, deputy project scientist for the mission. This study uses weeks of tracking radio signals from the stationary rover to measure wobble in the planet's rotation. The amount of wobble is an indicator of whether the core of the planet is molten, similar to the way spinning an egg can be used to determine whether it is raw or hard-boiled. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Other research at Greeley Haven includes long-term data gathering to investigate mineral ingredients of the outcrop with spectrometers on Opportunity's arm, and repeated observations to monitor wind-caused changes at various scales. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Moessbauer spectrometer, which identifies iron-containing minerals, uses radiation from cobalt-57 in the instrument to elicit a response from molecules in the rock. The half-life of cobalt-57 is only about nine months, so this source has diminished greatly.

      "\n",
      "<p>PASADENA, Calif. -- NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft successfully refined its flight path Wednesday with the biggest maneuver planned for the mission's journey between Earth and Mars.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />\"We've completed a big step toward our encounter with Mars,\" said Brian Portock of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., deputy mission manager for the cruise phase of the mission. \"The telemetry from the spacecraft and the Doppler data show that the maneuver was completed as planned.\"\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />The Mars Science Laboratory mission will use its car-size rover, Curiosity, to investigate whether the selected region on Mars inside Gale Crater has offered environmental conditions favorable for supporting microbial life and favorable for preserving clues about whether life existed.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />Engineers had planned today's three-hour series of thruster-engine firings to accomplish two aims: to put the spacecraft's trajectory about 25,000 miles (about 40,000 kilometers) closer to encountering Mars and to advance the time of the encounter by about 14 hours, compared with the trajectory following the mission's Nov. 26, 2011, launch.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />\"The timing of the encounter is important for arriving at Mars just when the planet's rotation puts Gale Crater in the right place,\" said JPL's Tomas Martin-Mur, chief navigator for the mission.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />The mission's second trajectory correction maneuver, expected to be about one-sixth the magnitude of this first one, is scheduled for March 26. Up to four additional opportunities for fine-tuning, as needed, are scheduled before the arrival at Mars on Aug. 5, 2012, PDT (Aug. 6, EDT and Universal Time).\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />The spacecraft's initial trajectory resulting from the launch included an intentional offset to prevent the upper stage of the launch vehicle from hitting Mars. That upper stage was not cleaned the way the spacecraft itself was to protect Mars from Earth's microbes.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />The Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft rotates in flight at about two revolutions per minute. Today's maneuver included two different components: one that changed velocity in the direction of the axis of the spacecraft's rotation, and one that changed velocity in a direction perpendicular to that.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />The maneuver used the eight thruster engines on the cruise stage of the spacecraft, grouped into two sets of four. It began with a thrust lasting about 19 minutes, using just one thruster in each set and affecting velocity along the direction of the axis of rotation. Then, to affect velocity perpendicular to that line, each set of thrusters was fired for 5 seconds when the rotation put that set facing the proper direction. These 5-second bursts were repeated more than 200 times during a period of about two hours for a total of about 40 minutes.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />The maneuver was calculated to produce a net change in velocity of about 12.3 miles per hour (5.5 meters per second), combining a slight increase in speed with a small change in direction of travel.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />As of 9 a.m. PST (noon EST) on Thursday, Jan. 12, the spacecraft will have traveled 81.2 million miles (130.6 million kilometers) of its 352-million-mile (567-million-kilometer) flight to Mars. It will be moving at about 10,300 mph (16,600 kilometers per hour) relative to Earth, and at about 68,700 mph (110,500 kilometers per hour) relative to the sun.\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>The mission's schedule before arrival at Mars on Aug. 5 in PDT (Aug. 6 in Universal Time and EDT) includes opportunities for five more flight path correction maneuvers, as needed, for fine tuning.</p>\n",

In tests at JPL, that behavior has been reproduced a few times out of thousands of test runs on a duplicate of the spacecraft's computer, but no resets were triggered during similar testing on another duplicate. The spacecraft itself has redundant main computers. While the spacecraft is operating on the \"A side\" computer, engineers are beginning test runs of the star-identifying software on the redundant \"B side\" computer to check whether it is susceptible to the same reset behavior. </p>\n",

      "</div>PASADENA, Calif. -- NASA's car-sized Curiosity rover has begun monitoring space radiation during its 8-month trip from Earth to Mars. The research will aid in planning for future human missions to the Red Planet.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />Curiosity launched on Nov. 26 from Cape Canaveral, Fla., aboard the Mars Science Laboratory. The rover carries an instrument called the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) that monitors high-energy atomic and subatomic particles from the sun, distant supernovas and other sources.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />These particles constitute radiation that could be harmful to any microbes or astronauts in space or on Mars. The rover also will monitor radiation on the surface of Mars after its August 2012 landing.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />\"RAD is serving as a proxy for an astronaut inside a spacecraft on the way to Mars,\" said Don Hassler, RAD's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo. \"The instrument is deep inside the spacecraft, the way an astronaut would be. Understanding the effects of the spacecraft on the radiation field will be valuable in designing craft for astronauts to travel to Mars.\"\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />Previous monitoring of energetic-particle radiation in space has used instruments at or near the surface of various spacecraft. The RAD instrument is on the rover inside the spacecraft and shielded by other components of Mars Science Laboratory, including the aeroshell that will protect the rover during descent through the upper atmosphere of Mars.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />Spacecraft structures, while providing shielding, also can contribute to secondary particles generated when high-energy particles strike the spacecraft. In some circumstances, secondary particles could be more hazardous than primary ones.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />These first measurements mark the start of the science return from a mission that will use 10 instruments on Curiosity to assess whether Mars' Gale Crater could be or has been favorable for microbial life.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />\"While Curiosity will not look for signs of life on Mars, what it might find could be a game-changer about the origin and evolution of life on Earth and elsewhere in the universe,\" said Doug McCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"One thing is certain: The rover's discoveries will provide critical data that will impact human and robotic planning and research for decades.\"\n",
      "<br />As of 9 a.m. PST (noon EST) on Dec. 14, the spacecraft will have traveled 31.9 million miles (51.3 million kilometers) of its 352-million-mile (567-million-kilometer) flight to Mars. The first trajectory correction maneuver during the trip is being planned for mid-January.\n",

      "</div>PASADENA, Calif. -- NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity has found bright veins of a mineral, apparently gypsum, deposited by water. Analysis of the vein will help improve understanding of the history of wet environments on Mars.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"This tells a slam-dunk story that water flowed through underground fractures in the rock,\" said Steve Squyres of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., principal investigator for Opportunity. \"This stuff is a fairly pure chemical deposit that formed in place right where we see it. That can't be said for other gypsum seen on Mars or for other water-related minerals Opportunity has found. It's not uncommon on Earth, but on Mars, it's the kind of thing that makes geologists jump out of their chairs.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The latest findings by Opportunity were presented Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union's conference in San Francisco.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The vein examined most closely by Opportunity is about the width of a human thumb (0.4 to 0.8 inch, or 1 to 2 centimeters), 16 to 20 inches (40 to 50 centimeters) long, and protrudes slightly higher than the bedrock on either side of it. Observations by the durable rover reveal this vein and others like it within an apron surrounding a segment of the rim of Endeavour Crater. None like it were seen in the 20 miles (33 kilometers) of crater-pocked plains that Opportunity explored for 90 months before it reached Endeavour, nor in the higher ground of the rim.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Last month, researchers used the Microscopic Imager and Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer on the rover's arm and multiple filters of the Panoramic Camera on the rover's mast to examine the vein, which is informally named \"Homestake.\"  The spectrometer identified plentiful calcium and sulfur, in a ratio pointing to relatively pure calcium sulfate. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Calcium sulfate can exist in many forms, varying by how much water is bound into the minerals' crystalline structure. The multi-filter data from the camera suggest gypsum, a hydrated calcium sulfate. On Earth, gypsum is used for making drywall and plaster of Paris.\n",
      "<br />Observations from orbit had detected gypsum on Mars previously. A dune field of windblown gypsum on far northern Mars resembles the glistening gypsum dunes in White Sands National Monument in New Mexico. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"It is a mystery where the gypsum sand on northern Mars comes from,\" said Opportunity science-team member Benton Clark of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo. \"At Homestake, we see the mineral right where it formed. It will be important to see if there are deposits like this in other areas of Mars.\"  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Homestake deposit, whether gypsum or another form of calcium sulfate, likely formed from water dissolving calcium out of volcanic rocks. The calcium combined with sulfur that was either leached from the rocks or introduced as volcanic gas, and it was deposited as calcium sulfate into an underground fracture that later became exposed at the surface. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Throughout Opportunity's long traverse across Mars' Meridiani plain, the rover has driven over bedrock composed of magnesium, iron and calcium sulfate minerals that also indicate a wet environment billions of years ago. The highly concentrated calcium sulfate at Homestake could have been produced in conditions more neutral than the harshly acidic conditions indicated by the other sulfate deposits observed by Opportunity. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"It could have formed in a different type of water environment, one more hospitable for a larger variety of living organisms,\" Clark said.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Homestake and similar-looking veins appear in a zone where the sulfate-rich sedimentary bedrock of the plains meets older, volcanic bedrock exposed at the rim of Endeavour. That location may offer a clue about their origin.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Opportunity and its rover twin, Spirit, completed their three-month prime missions on Mars in April 2004. Both rovers continued for years of extended missions and made important discoveries about wet environments on ancient Mars that may have been favorable for supporting microbial life. Spirit stopped communicating in 2010. Opportunity continues exploring, currently heading to a sun-facing slope on the northern end of the Endeavour rim fragment called \"Cape York\" to keep its solar panels at a favorable angle during the mission's fifth Martian winter. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p> \"We want to understand why these veins are in the apron but not out on the plains,\" said the mission's deputy principal investigator, Ray Arvidson, of Washington University in St. Louis. \"The answer may be that rising groundwater coming from the ancient crust moved through material adjacent to Cape York and deposited gypsum, because this material would be relatively insoluble compared with either magnesium or iron sulfates.\"</p>\n",

      "</div>PASADENA, Calif. - Excellent launch precision for NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission has forestalled the need for an early trajectory correction maneuver, now not required for a month or more.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />That first of six planned course adjustments during the 254-day journey from Earth to Mars had originally been scheduled for 15 days after the mission's Nov. 26 launch on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. Now, the correction maneuver will not be performed until later in December or possibly January.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />\"This was among the most accurate interplanetary injections ever,\" said Louis D'Amario of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.  He is the mission design and navigation manager for the Mars Science Laboratory.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />Engineers deliberately planned the spacecraft's initial trajectory to miss Mars by about 35,000 miles (56,400 kilometers). This precaution protects Mars from Earth's microbes, because the Centaur upper stage of the launch vehicle, which is not thoroughly cleaned the way the spacecraft is, leaves Earth on the same trajectory as the spacecraft. The planned trajectory ensures that the Centaur will not hit Mars.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />The launch put the spacecraft on an actual trajectory missing Mars by about 38,000 miles (61,200 kilometers). Planned trajectory correction maneuvers will put the spacecraft on course and on timing to land at Mars' Gale Crater on Aug. 6, 2012, Universal Time (evening of Aug. 5, Pacific Daylight Time).\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />The spacecraft experienced a computer reset on Tuesday apparently related to star-identifying software in the attitude control system. The reset put the spacecraft briefly into a precautionary safe mode. Engineers restored it to normal operational status for functions other than attitude control while planning resumption of star-guided attitude control.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />Also on Tuesday, thrusters were used as planned to slow the spacecraft's rotation rate from 2.5 rotations per minute to 2.05 rotations per minute. Telecommunications are active at a downlink rate of 25 kilobits per second. Electrical output from the cruise stage solar array is 800 watts. Thrusters warmed by catalytic bed heaters were originally warmer than expected, but use of the heaters has been reduced to keep the thrusters at intended temperatures.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />As of 9 a.m. PST (noon EST) on Friday, Dec. 2, the spacecraft will have traveled 10.8 million miles (17.3 million kilometers) of its 352-million-mile (567-million-kilometer) flight to Mars, and will be moving at 7,500 mph (12,000 kilometers per hour) relative to Earth and at 73,800 mph (118,700 kilometers per hour) relative to the sun.\n",

Liftoff from Cape Canaveral Air  Force Station aboard an Atlas V rocket occurred at 10:02 a.m. EST (7:02 a.m.  PST). \n",
      "<br />  \n",
      "<br />\"We are very excited about sending the world's most advanced scientific  laboratory to Mars,\" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said. \"MSL  will tell us critical things we need to know about Mars, and while it advances  science, we'll be working on the capabilities for a human mission to the Red  Planet and to other destinations where we've never been.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The mission will pioneer precision landing  technology and a sky-crane touchdown to place Curiosity near the foot of a  mountain inside Gale Crater on Aug. 6, 2012. During a nearly two-year prime  mission after landing, the rover will investigate whether the region has ever  offered conditions favorable for microbial life, including the chemical  ingredients for life. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The launch vehicle has given us a great  injection into our trajectory, and we're on our way to Mars,\" said Mars  Science Laboratory Project Manager Peter Theisinger of NASA's Jet Propulsion  Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"The spacecraft is in communication,  thermally stable and power positive.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Atlas V initially lofted the spacecraft into  Earth orbit and then, with a second burst from the vehicle's upper stage,  pushed it out of Earth orbit into a 352-million-mile (567-million-kilometer)  journey to Mars.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Our first trajectory correction maneuver will  be in about two weeks,\" Theisinger said. \"We'll do instrument  checkouts in the next several weeks and continue with thorough preparations for  the landing on Mars and operations on the surface.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity's ambitious science goals are among the  mission's many differences from earlier Mars rovers. It will use a drill and  scoop at the end of its robotic arm to gather soil and powdered samples of rock  interiors, then sieve and parcel out these samples into analytical laboratory  instruments inside the rover. Curiosity carries 10 science instruments with a  total mass 15 times as large as the science-instrument payloads on the Mars  rovers Spirit and Opportunity. Some of the tools are the first of their kind on  Mars, such as a laser-firing instrument for checking the elemental composition of  rocks from a distance, and an X-ray diffraction instrument for definitive  identification of minerals in powdered samples.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>To haul and wield its science payload, Curiosity is  twice as long and five times as heavy as Spirit or Opportunity. Because of its  one-ton mass, Curiosity is too heavy to employ airbags to cushion its landing  as previous Mars rovers could. Part of the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft  is a rocket-powered descent stage that will lower the rover on tethers as the  rocket engines control the speed of descent.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The mission's landing site offers Curiosity access  for driving to layers of the mountain inside Gale Crater. Observations from  orbit have identified clay and sulfate minerals in the lower layers, indicating  a wet history. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Precision landing maneuvers as the spacecraft flies  through the Martian atmosphere before opening its parachute make Gale a safe  target for the first time. This innovation shrinks the target area to less than  one-fourth the size of earlier Mars landing targets. Without it, rough terrain  at the edges of Curiosity's target would make the site unacceptably hazardous.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The innovations for  landing a heavier spacecraft with greater precision are steps in technology  development for human Mars missions.

      "</div>Maybe because it appears as a speck of blood in the sky, the planet Mars was named after the Roman god of war. From the point of view of life as we know it, that's appropriate. The Martian surface is incredibly hostile for life. The Red Planet's thin atmosphere does little to shield the ground against radiation from the Sun and space. Harsh chemicals, like hydrogen peroxide, permeate the soil. Liquid water, a necessity for life, can't exist for very long here-any that does not quickly evaporate in the diffuse air will soon freeze out in subzero temperatures common over much of the planet. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>It wasn't always this way. There are signs that in the distant past, billions of years ago, Mars was a much more inviting place. Martian terrain is carved with channels that resemble dry riverbeds. Spacecraft sent to orbit Mars have identified patches of minerals that form only in the presence of liquid water. It appears that in its youth, Mars was a place that could have harbored life, with a thicker atmosphere warm enough for rain that formed lakes or even seas. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Two new NASA missions, one that will roam the surface and another that will orbit the planet and dip briefly into its upper atmosphere, will try to discover what transformed Mars. \"The ultimate driver for these missions is the question, did Mars ever have life?\" says Paul Mahaffy of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. \"Did microbial life ever originate on Mars, and what happened to it as the planet changed? Did it just go extinct, or did it go underground, where it would be protected from space radiation and temperatures might be warm enough for liquid water?\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission features Curiosity, the largest and most advanced rover ever sent to the Red Planet. The Curiosity rover bristles with multiple cameras and instruments, including Goddard's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument suite. By looking for evidence of water, carbon, and other important building blocks of life in the Martian soil and atmosphere, SAM will help discover whether Mars ever had the potential to support life. Scheduled to launch in late November or December 2011, Curiosity will be delivered to Gale crater, a 96-mile-wide crater that contains a record of environmental changes in its sedimentary rock, in August 2012.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission, scheduled to launch in late 2013, will orbit Mars and is devoted to understanding the Red Planet's upper atmosphere. It will help determine what caused the Martian atmosphere-and water- to be lost to space, making the climate increasingly inhospitable for life. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Both MAVEN and Curiosity/SAM will determine the history of the Martian climate and atmosphere using multiple approaches,\" said MAVEN Principal Investigator Bruce Jakosky of the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics. \"Measurements of isotope ratios are an approach shared by both missions.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Isotopes are heavier versions of an element. For example, deuterium is a heavy version of hydrogen. Normally, two atoms of hydrogen join to an oxygen atom to make a water molecule, but sometimes the heavy (and rare) deuterium takes a hydrogen atom's place. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When water gets lofted into Mars' upper atmosphere, solar radiation can break it apart into hydrogen (or deuterium) and oxygen. Hydrogen escapes faster because it is lighter than deuterium. Since the lighter version escapes more often, over time, the Martian atmosphere has less and less hydrogen compared to the amount of deuterium remaining. The Martian atmosphere therefore becomes richer and richer in deuterium.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The MAVEN team will measure the amount of deuterium compared to the amount of hydrogen in Mars' upper atmosphere, which is the planet's present-day deuterium to hydrogen (D/H) ratio. They will compare it to the ratio Mars had when it was young-the early D/H ratio. (The early ratio can be measured from the D/H ratio in ancient Martian minerals and estimated from observations of the D/H ratio in comets and asteroids, which are believed to be pristine, \"fossil\" remnants of our solar system's formation.)</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Comparing the present and early D/H ratios will allow the team to calculate how much hydrogen (and, therefore, water) has been lost over Mars' lifetime. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>MAVEN will also determine how much Martian atmosphere has been lost over time by measuring the isotope ratios of other elements in the very high atmosphere, such as nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, and noble gases like argon.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>MAVEN is expected to reach Mars in 2014. By then, SAM on board the Curiosity rover will have made similar measurements from Gale crater, which will help guide the interpretation of MAVEN's upper atmosphere measurements.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Measuring isotopes in the atmosphere will reveal its present state. To find out what the Martian atmosphere was like in the past, scientists will use what they discover with MAVEN about the various ways the atmosphere is being removed. With that data, they will build computer simulations, or models, to estimate the condition of the Red Planet's atmosphere billions of years ago.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Scientists estimate Gale crater may have formed more than three billion years ago. Curiosity will grind up Gale crater minerals and deliver them to SAM so the isotope ratios can be measured, giving a glimpse at the Martian atmosphere from long ago, perhaps when it could have supported life. \"SAM's inputs from the surface of past Martian history will help the MAVEN team work backwards to discover how the Martian atmosphere evolved,\" said Joseph Grebowsky of NASA Goddard, MAVEN Project Scientist.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"For example, MAVEN will focus primarily on how solar activity erodes the Martian atmosphere,\" adds Mahaffy. Things like the solar wind, a tenuous stream of electrically conducting gas blown from the surface of the Sun, and explosions in the Sun's atmosphere called solar flares, and eruptions of solar material called coronal mass ejections can all strip away the upper atmosphere of Mars in various ways. \"If we figure out how much atmosphere is removed by changes in solar activity, we can extrapolate back to estimate what the isotope ratios should have been billions of years ago. However, if the measurements of the ancient ratios from SAM don't match up, this suggests that we may have to look at other ways the atmosphere could have been lost, such as giant impacts from asteroids,\" says Mahaffy, who is Principal Investigator for SAM and Instrument Lead for the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer instrument on MAVEN. Some scientists believe giant impacts could have blasted significant amounts of the Martian atmosphere into space.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Also, Curiosity will carry a weather station, which will help the MAVEN team understand how changes in the upper atmosphere are related to changes at the surface. \"For example, if the rover detects a dust storm, it may have an effect higher up because of the winds and the gravity waves (the bobbing up and down of a parcel of air) it sets up,\" says Grebowsky.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Curiosity will focus on geology and minerals to determine if the environment on Mars in the distant past had the potential to support life,\" said Mahaffy. \"It will be digging in the dirt trying to understand the habitability issue in a place where water may have flowed, where there could have been a lake. Habitability is also the basic theme of MAVEN - it will be trying to understand from the top down how the atmosphere evolved over time and how it was lost, which ties back to how clement it was early on.\" </p>\n",

      "</div>PASADENA, Calif. -- Images from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show sand dunes and ripples moving across the surface of Mars at dozens of locations and shifting up to several yards. These observations reveal the planet's sandy surface is more dynamic than previously thought.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Mars either has more gusts of wind than we knew about before, or the winds are capable of transporting more sand,\" said Nathan Bridges, planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., and lead author of a paper on the finding published online in the journal Geology. \"We used to think of the sand on Mars as relatively immobile, so these new observations are changing our whole perspective.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>While red dust is known to swirl all around Mars in storms and dust devils, the planet's dark sand grains are larger and harder to move. Less than a decade ago, scientists thought the dunes and ripples on Mars either did not budge or moved too slowly for detection. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>MRO was launched in 2005. Initial images from the spacecraft's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera documented only a few cases of shifting sand dunes and ripples, collectively called bedforms. Now, after years of monitoring the Martian surface, the spacecraft has documented movements of a few yards (or meters) per year in dozens of locations across the planet. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The air on Mars is thin, so stronger gusts of wind are needed to push a grain of sand. Wind-tunnel experiments have shown that a patch of sand would take winds of about 80 mph (nearly 130 kilometers per hour) to move on Mars compared with only 10 mph (about 16 kilometers per hour) on Earth. Measurements from the meteorology experiments on NASA's Viking landers in the 1970s and early 1980s, in addition to climate models, showed such winds should be rare on Mars.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The first hints that Martian dunes move came from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor, which operated from 1997 to 2006. But the spacecraft's cameras lacked the resolution to definitively detect the changes. NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers also detected hints of shifting sand when they touched down on the Red Planet's surface in 2004. The mission team was surprised to see grains of sand dotting the rovers' solar panels. They also witnessed the rovers' track marks filling in with sand. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Sand moves by hopping from place to place,\" said Matthew Golombek, a co-author of the new paper and a member of the Mars Exploration Rover and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter teams at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"Before the rovers landed on Mars, we had no clear evidence of sand moving.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Not all of the sand on Mars is blowing in the wind. The study also identifies several areas where the bedforms did not move. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The sand dunes where we didn't see movement today could have larger grains, or perhaps their surface layers are cemented together,\" said Bridges, who also is a member of the HiRISE team. \"These studies show the benefit of long-term monitoring at high resolution.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>According to scientists, the seemingly stationary areas might move on much larger time scales, triggered by climate cycles on Mars that last tens of thousands of years. The tilt of Mars' axis relative to its orbital plane can vary dramatically. This, combined with the oval shape of Mars' orbit, can cause extreme changes in the Martian climate, much greater than those experienced on Earth. Mars may once have been warm enough that the carbon dioxide now frozen in the polar ice caps could have been free to form a thicker atmosphere, leading to stronger winds capable of transporting sand.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>\"Preparations are on track for launching at our first opportunity,\" said Pete Theisinger, Mars Science Laboratory project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"If weather or other factors prevent launching then, we have more opportunities through Dec. 18.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Scheduled to land on the Red Planet in August 2012, the one-ton rover will examine Gale Crater during a nearly two-year prime mission. Curiosity will land near the base of a layered mountain 3 miles (5 kilometers) high inside the crater. The rover will investigate whether environmental conditions ever have been favorable for development of microbial life and preserved evidence of those conditions.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Gale gives us a superb opportunity to test multiple potentially habitable environments and the context to understand a very long record of early environmental evolution of the planet,\" said John Grotzinger, project scientist for the Mars Science Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \"The portion of the crater where Curiosity will land has an alluvial fan likely formed by water-carried sediments. Layers at the base of the mountain contain clays and sulfates, both known to form in water.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity is twice as long and five times as heavy as earlier Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity. The rover will carry a set of 10 science instruments weighing 15 times as much as its predecessors' science payloads. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A mast extending to 7 feet (2.1 meters) above ground provides height for cameras and a laser-firing instrument to study targets from a distance. Instruments on a 7-foot-long (2.1-meter-long) arm will study targets up close. Analytical instruments inside the rover will determine the composition of rock and soil samples acquired with the arm's powdering drill and scoop. Other instruments will characterize the environment, including the weather and natural radiation that will affect future human missions. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Mars Science Laboratory builds upon the improved understanding about Mars gained from current and recent missions,\" said Doug McCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"This mission advances technologies and science that will move us toward missions to return samples from, and eventually send humans to, Mars.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The mission is challenging and risky. Because Curiosity is too heavy to use an air-bag cushioned touchdown, the mission will use a new landing method, with a rocket-powered descent stage lowering the rover on a tether like a kind of sky-crane. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The mission will pioneer precision landing methods during the spacecraft's crucial dive through Mars' atmosphere next August to place the rover onto a smaller landing target than any previously for a Mars mission. The target inside Gale Crater is 12.4 miles (20 kilometers) by 15.5 miles (25 kilometers). Rough terrain just outside that area would have disqualified the landing site without the improved precision.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>No mission to Mars since the Viking landers in the 1970s has sought a direct answer to the question of whether life has existed on Mars. Curiosity is not designed to answer that question by itself, but its investigations for evidence about prerequisites for life will steer potential future missions toward answers. </p>\n",

      "</div>PASADENA, Calif. -- A new NASA study suggests if life ever existed on Mars, the longest lasting habitats were most likely below the Red Planet's surface.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A new interpretation of years of mineral-mapping data, from more than 350 sites on Mars examined by European and NASA orbiters, suggests Martian environments with abundant liquid water on the surface existed only during short episodes. These episodes occurred toward the end of a period of hundreds of millions of years during which warm water interacted with subsurface rocks. This has implications about whether life existed on Mars and how the Martian atmosphere has changed. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The types of clay minerals that formed in the shallow subsurface are all over Mars,\" said John Mustard, professor at Brown University in Providence, R.I. Mustard is a co-author of the study in the journal Nature. \"The types that formed on the surface are found at very limited locations and are quite rare.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Discovery of clay minerals on Mars in 2005 indicated the planet once hosted warm, wet conditions. If those conditions existed on the surface for a long era, the planet would have needed a much thicker atmosphere than it has now to keep the water from evaporating or freezing. Researchers have sought evidence of processes that could cause a thick atmosphere to be lost over time. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This new study supports an alternative hypothesis that persistent warm water was confined to the subsurface and many erosional features were carved during brief periods when liquid water was stable at the surface. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"If surface habitats were short-term, that doesn't mean we should be glum about prospects for life on Mars, but it says something about what type of environment we might want to look in,\" said the report's lead author, Bethany Ehlmann, assistant professor at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, and scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, also in Pasadena. \"The most stable Mars habitats over long durations appear to have been in the subsurface. On Earth, underground geothermal environments have active ecosystems.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The discovery of clay minerals by the OMEGA spectrometer on the European Space Agency's Mars Express orbiter added to earlier evidence of liquid Martian water. Clays form from the interaction of water with rock. Different types of clay minerals result from different types of wet conditions. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>During the past five years, researchers used OMEGA and NASA's Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer, or CRISM, instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to identify clay minerals at thousands of locations on Mars. Clay minerals that form where the ratio of water interacting with rock is small generally retain the same chemical elements as those found in the original volcanic rocks later altered by the water. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The study interprets this to be the case for most terrains on Mars with iron and magnesium clays. In contrast, surface environments with higher ratios of water to rock can alter rocks further. Soluble elements are carried off by water, and different aluminum-rich clays form. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Another clue is detection of a mineral called prehnite. It forms at temperatures above about 400 degrees Fahrenheit (about 200 degrees Celsius). These temperatures are typical of underground hydrothermal environments rather than surface waters.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Our interpretation is a shift from thinking that the warm, wet environment was mostly at the surface to thinking it was mostly in the subsurface, with limited exceptions,\" said Scott Murchie of Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., a co-author of the report and principal investigator for CRISM.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>One of the exceptions may be Gale Crater, the site targeted by NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission. Launching this year, the mission’s Curiosity rover will land and investigate layers that contain clay and sulfate minerals. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission, or MAVEN, in development for a 2013 launch, may provide evidence for or against this new interpretation of the Red Planet's environmental history.

      "<p>The Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons instrument, or DAN, will scout for underground clues to a depth of about 20 inches (50 centimeters). The Russian Federal Space Agency contributed it to NASA as part of a broad collaboration between the United States and Russia in the exploration of space. Sergey Saveliev, deputy head of the Russian Federal Space Agency, emphasized that the cooperation on this project serves as a continuation of the joint activities associated with the study of Mars to enhance the scientific return to the international community in the areas of Mars exploration and Mars knowledge. The accommodation and integration of the Russian DAN in the U.S. Mars Science Laboratory flight and mission systems give evidence of strengthening cooperation between the two countries in space endeavors.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>DAN will bring to the surface of Mars an enhancement of nuclear technology that has already detected Martian water from orbit. \"Albedo\" in the instrument's name means reflectance -- in this case, how original high-energy neutrons injected into the ground bounce off atomic nuclei in the ground. Neutrons that collide with hydrogen atoms bounce off with a characteristic decrease in energy, similar to how one billiard ball slows after colliding with another. By measuring the energies of the neutrons leaking from the ground, DAN can detect the fraction that was slowed in these collisions, and therefore the amount of hydrogen.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Oil prospectors use this technology in instruments lowered down exploration holes to detect the hydrogen in petroleum. Space explorers have adapted it for missions to the moon and Mars, where most hydrogen is in water ice or in water-derived hydroxyl ions.  </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Mitrofanov is the principal investigator for a Russian instrument on NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter, the high-energy neutron detector (HEND), which measures high energy of neutrons coming from Mars. In 2002, it and companion instruments on Odyssey detected hydrogen interpreted as abundant underground water ice close to the surface at high latitudes. That discovery led to NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander going to far northern Mars in 2008 and confirming the presence of water ice. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"You can think of DAN as a reconnaissance instrument,\" Mitrofanov said. Just as Phoenix investigated what Odyssey detected, Curiosity can use various tools to investigate what DAN detects. The rover has a soil scoop and can also dig with its wheels. Its robotic arm can put samples into instruments inside the rover for thorough analyses of ingredients. Rock formations that Curiosity's cameras view at the surface can be traced underground with DAN, enhancing the ability of scientists to understand the geology.</p>\n",

      "<p>The neutron detectors on Odyssey rely on galactic cosmic rays hitting Mars as a source of neutrons. DAN can work in a passive mode relying on cosmic rays, but it also has its own pulsing neutron generator for an active mode of shooting high-energy neutrons into the ground. In active mode, it is sensitive enough to detect water content as low as one-tenth of one percent in the ground beneath the rover.  </p>\n",

The generator will be able to emit a total of about 10 million pulses during the mission, with about 10 million neutrons at each pulse. </p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>Operational planning anticipates using DAN during short pauses in drives and while the rover is parked. It will check for any changes or trends in subsurface hydrogen content, from place to place along the traverse. Because there is a low possibility for underground water ice at Curiosity's Gale crater landing site, the most likely form of hydrogen in the ground of the landing area is hydrated minerals. These are minerals with water molecules or hydroxyl ions bound into the crystalline structure of the mineral. They can tenaciously retain water from a wetter past when all free water has gone.</p>\n",

      "<p>Mars Science Laboratory Project Scientist John Grotzinger of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena said, \"DAN will provide the ability to detect hydrated minerals or water ice in the shallow subsurface, which provides immediate clues as to how the geology of the subsurface might guide exploration of the surface. In addition, DAN can tell us how the shallow subsurface may differ from what the rover sees at the surface. None of our other instruments have the ability to do this. DAN measurements will tell us about the habitability potential of subsurface rocks and soils -- whether they contain water -- and as we drive along, DAN may help us understand what kinds of rocks are under the soils we drive across.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>Information from DAN will also provide a ground-truth calibration for the measurements that the gamma-ray and neutron detectors on Odyssey have made and continue to make, all around the planet, enhancing the value of that global data set. The team leader of Odyssey's gamma-ray spectrometer suite, William Boynton of the University of Arizona in Tucson, is a co-investigator on the DAN investigation, with the major responsibility to provide DAN data products to NASA's Planetary Data System for usage by scientists everywhere. </p>\n",

After that, the \"sky crane\" inside the capsule will activate to lower the subcompact-car-sized Curiosity rover on tethers, suspending it beneath the rest of the craft until the whole assembly descends onto a carefully chosen patch of ground at the northwestern end of the 96-mile-diameter crater. </p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>Rice, a planetary geologist, has been thinking about MSL's landing because he participated in the process of choosing where the spacecraft will touch down. That meant attending a series of site-selection workshops, along with researchers from across the planetary science community, to consider nearly 60 potential landing sites. It also meant paying special attention to exactly how flat, how high, how windy, how dusty and how rocky certain regions of Mars are, as well as evaluating how interesting the geology is in those places.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>He advocated for Eberswalde crater, which he favored because of its delta. Though it's been dry for eons, the delta resembles the mouth of a river here on Earth. Because the goal of MSL is to assess whether Mars was ever a habitable environment, Rice explains, every potential landing site \"had to have a water story-some evidence that water was involved in the formation of the landscape and in the rock deposited there.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A site also had to have the potential to preserve biomarkers, the telltale indicators that organic material was once present. Any regions that didn't satisfy these two science objectives were eliminated. Once the list of candidates was pared down to half a dozen, the competition got tough. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"When you suggest a site at these meetings, you get grilled by the project engineers, the mission's science team and other scientists who are proposing alternative sites,\" says Rice. \"You have to defend your choice through all kinds of ups and downs.

      "\n",
      "<p>When Pathfinder landed at Ares Vallis, the site he helped propose, he was hooked. He participated in site selections for the Mars Polar Lander and Phoenix as well as Spirit and Opportunity, the two vehicles of the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission. With MSL, he will have been involved in six missions that landed, or will soon land, on Mars.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>By 2008, Eberswalde was hanging tough as one of MSL's final four, along with Gale crater, Holden crater and Mawrth Vallis. From data gathered by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, researchers knew that all four sites had clays called phyllosilicates, which meant the ancient water had to stick around long enough to break down rock. All four sites were also given the thumbs-up by engineers as being safe. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>But ultimately, Gale crater, with its mysterious mound that rises higher than Mount Rainier near Seattle, won out.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"That mound is so enigmatic,\" says Rice. \"We know that there are clays in it and also sulfates, another indication of water. But how did that mound get there? Did volcanic ash and dust blow in and contribute to the buildup of the mound? How and why did the area around it erode away? When water was there, where did it come from?\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>To look for answers, the rover will drive at least partway up the mound, which Rice likens to exploring the Grand Canyon, but backwards. \"As you hike down into the Grand Canyon, you go through all these rock layers. Every step takes you back in time,\" he explains. \"But at Gale, we'll be climbing up through the layers instead.\"</p>\n",

The car-sized rover, also known as the Mars Science Lab, is scheduled for launch in late November or early December 2011 from the Kennedy Space Center.

      "\n",
      "<p>\"This may be one of the thickest exposed sections of layered sedimentary rocks in the solar system. The rock record preserved in those layers holds stories that are billions of years old -- stories about whether, when, and for how long Mars might have been habitable.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p> Today the Red Planet is a radiation-drenched, bitterly cold, bleak world. Enormous dust storms explode across the barren landscape and darken Martian skies for months at a time. But data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter suggest that Mars once hosted vast lakes and flowing rivers.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Gale Crater and its mountain will tell this intriguing story,\" says Matthew Golombek, Mars Exploration Program Landing Site Scientist from JPL. \"The layers there chronicle Mars' environmental history.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Gale crater photographed from above by NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter. Within Gale, an impressive layered mountain rises about 5 kilometers (3 miles) above the crater floor.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In the gentle slopes around the mountain, Curiosity will prospect for organic molecules, the chemical building blocks of life. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has found an intriguing signature of clay near the bottom of the mountain and sulfate minerals a little higher up. Both minerals are formed in the presence of water, which increases potential for life-friendly environments.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"All the types of aqueous minerals we've detected on Mars to date can be found in this one location,\" explains Golombek.\n",
      "<br />Clay settles slowly in water and forms little platelets that conform around things, hardening over time and encasing them in 'casts.\" Clay could seal organics off from the outside environment much like it preserved dinosaur bones on Earth.\n",
      "<br />\"If organics ever existed on Mars, they could be preserved in the clay.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Even on planet Earth, teeming with life, finding billion year-old well-preserved organics is difficult. But Curiosity will find them if they're present in the samples it takes.  The rover is equipped with the most advanced suite of instruments for scientific studies ever sent to the Martian surface1.  When these are brought to bear on Gale crater’s mysteriously layered mountain, the odds of a discovery will be at an all-time high.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>As seasoned travelers know, however, the journey is just as important as the destination. Curiosity can travel up to 150 meters per Mars day, but will stop often to gather and analyze samples.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"It could take several months to a year to reach the foot of the mountain, depending on how often the rover stops along the way,\" says Golombek. \"There will be plenty to examine before getting to the central mound.\"\n",
      "<br />A high-resolution camera on the rover's mast will take pictures and movies of the scenery, taking Earthlings on an extraterrestrial sightseeing tour.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"As Curiosity climbs toward higher layers, you'll see spectacular valleys and canyons like those in the U.S. desert southwest. The walls on either side of the rover will rise over 100 feet. The sights alone will be worth the trip.\"</p>\n",

      "</div>NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission has reached a new milestone. Lockheed Martin has completed building the primary structure of the MAVEN spacecraft at its Space Systems Company facility near Denver. The MAVEN spacecraft is scheduled to launch in November 2013 and will be the first mission devoted to understanding the Martian upper atmosphere. The mission's principal investigator is Bruce Jakosky from the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In the photo taken on Sept. 8, technicians from Lockheed Martin are inspecting the MAVEN primary structure following its recent completion at the company’s Composites Lab. The primary structure is cube shaped at 7.5 feet x 7.5 feet x 6.5 feet high (2.3 meters x 2.3 meters x 2 meters high).  Built out of composite panels comprised of aluminum honeycomb sandwiched between graphite composite face sheets and attached to one another with metal fittings, the entire structure only weighs 275 pounds (125 kilograms). At the center of the structure is the 4.25 feet (1.3 meters) diameter core cylinder that encloses the hydrazine propellant tank and serves as the primary vertical load-bearing structure. The large tank will hold approximately 3,615 pounds (1640 kilograms) of fuel. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>“It’s always a significant milestone when the project moves from a paper design to real hardware and software,” said Guy Beutelschies, MAVEN program manager at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company. “Seeing the core structure really reinforces the fact that MAVEN is no longer just a set of ideas that scientists and engineers have come up with, it is starting to become a spacecraft.”</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In mid October, the structure will be moved to Lockheed Martin’s Structures Test Lab and undergo static load testing, which simulates and tests the many dynamic loads the spacecraft will experience during launch. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Despite the primary structure’s light weight, it’s designed to support the entire spacecraft mass during the launch, which applies an equivalent axial force at the launch vehicle interface of approximately 61,000 pounds when including accelerations up to 6 Gs.  After completion of the static tests, the structure will be moved into a clean room to start propulsion subsystem integration. The Assembly, Test and Launch Operations (ATLO) phase begins July 2012. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"There’s still a lot of work to go before we have the complete spacecraft, but this is a major step in getting us to the launch pad in two years,\" said Bruce Jakosky, MAVEN principal investigator from the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado. \"All of the team's hard work now will pay off when we get to Mars and see the science results.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The goal of MAVEN is to determine the role that loss of atmospheric gas to space played in changing the Martian climate through time. MAVEN will determine how much of the Martian atmosphere has been lost over time by measuring the current rate of escape to space and gathering enough information about the relevant processes to allow extrapolation backward in time.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. manages the project and will also build some of the instruments for the mission. In addition to the principal investigator coming from CU-LASP, the university will provide science operations, build instruments, and lead education/public outreach. Lockheed Martin of Littleton, Colo., is building the spacecraft and will perform mission operations. The University of California-Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory is also building instruments for the mission. NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., will provide navigation support, the Deep Space Network, and the Electra telecommunications relay hardware and operations.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>\"NASA's Mars Exploration Program keeps bringing us closer to determining whether the Red Planet could harbor life in some form,” NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said, “and it reaffirms Mars as an important future destination for human exploration.\"\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />Dark, finger-like features appear and extend down some Martian slopes during late spring through summer, fade in winter, and return during the next spring. Repeated observations have tracked the seasonal changes in these recurring features on several steep slopes in the middle latitudes of Mars' southern hemisphere.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The best explanation for these observations so far is the flow of briny water,\" said Alfred McEwen of the University of Arizona, Tucson. McEwen is the principal investigator for the orbiter's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) and lead author of a report about the recurring flows published in Thursday's edition of the journal Science.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Some aspects of the observations still puzzle researchers, but flows of liquid brine fit the features' characteristics better than alternate hypotheses. Saltiness lowers the freezing temperature of water. Sites with active flows get warm enough, even in the shallow subsurface, to sustain liquid water that is about as salty as Earth's oceans, while pure water would freeze at the observed temperatures. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"These dark lineations are different from other types of features on Martian slopes,\" said Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Project Scientist Richard Zurek of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"Repeated observations show they extend ever farther downhill with time during the warm season.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The features imaged are only about 0.5 to 5 yards or meters wide, with lengths up to hundreds of yards. The width is much narrower than previously reported gullies on Martian slopes. However, some of those locations display more than 1,000 individual flows. Also, while gullies are abundant on cold, pole-facing slopes, these dark flows are on warmer, equator-facing slopes. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The images show flows lengthen and darken on rocky equator-facing slopes from late spring to early fall. The seasonality, latitude distribution and brightness changes suggest a volatile material is involved, but there is no direct detection of one. The settings are too warm for carbon-dioxide frost and, at some sites, too cold for pure water. This suggests the action of brines, which have lower freezing points. Salt deposits over much of Mars indicate brines were abundant in Mars' past. These recent observations suggest brines still may form near the surface today in limited times and places.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When researchers checked flow-marked slopes with the orbiter's Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM), no sign of water appeared. The features may quickly dry on the surface or could be shallow subsurface flows. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"The flows are not dark because of being wet,\" McEwen said. \"They are dark for some other reason.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A flow initiated by briny water could rearrange grains or change surface roughness in a way that darkens the appearance. How the features brighten again when temperatures drop is harder to explain. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"It's a mystery now, but I think it's a solvable mystery with further observations and laboratory experiments,\" McEwen said. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>These results are the closest scientists have come to finding evidence of liquid water on the planet's surface today. Frozen water, however has been detected near the surface in many middle to high-latitude regions. Fresh-looking gullies suggest slope movements in geologically recent times, perhaps aided by water. Purported droplets of brine also appeared on struts of the Phoenix Mars Lander. If further study of the recurring dark flows supports evidence of brines, these could be the first known Martian locations with liquid water.</p>\n",

The goal of MAVEN is to determine the history of the loss of atmospheric gases to space through time, providing answers about Mars climate evolution. It will accomplish this by measuring the current rate of escape to space and gathering enough information about the relevant processes to allow extrapolation backward in time. </p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>\"Understanding how and why the atmosphere changed through time is an important scientific objective for Mars,\" said Bruce Jakosky, MAVEN Principal Investigator from the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado (CU/LASP) at Boulder. \"MAVEN will make the right measurements to allow us to answer this question. We're in the middle of the hard work right now-building the instruments and spacecraft-and we're incredibly excited about the science results we're going to get from the mission.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>From July 11 - 15, 2011, the MAVEN Critical Design Review was held at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. An independent review board, comprised of reviewers from NASA and several external organizations, met to validate the system design. Critical Design Reviews are one-time programmatic events that bridge the design and manufacturing stages of a project. A successful review means that the design is validated and will meet its requirements, is backed up with solid analysis and documentation, and has been proven to be safe. MAVEN's CDR completion grants permission to the mission team to begin manufacturing hardware. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"This team continues to nail every major milestone like clockwork, as laid out three years ago when the mission was proposed,\" said Dave Mitchell, MAVEN Project Manager at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. \"CDR success is very important because it validates that the team is ready for fabrication, assembly, and test of all mission elements. It also enables us to stay on plan for launch in November 2013.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>MAVEN will carry three instrument suites. The Particles and Fields Package, built by the University of California at Berkeley with support from CU/LASP and NASA Goddard, contains six instruments that will characterize the solar wind and the ionosphere of the planet. The Remote Sensing Package, built by CU/LASP, will determine global characteristics of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere.

The target crater spans 96 miles (154 kilometers) in diameter and holds a mountain rising higher from the crater floor than Mount Rainier rises above Seattle. Gale is about the combined area of Connecticut and Rhode Island. Layering in the mound suggests it is the surviving remnant of an extensive sequence of deposits. The crater is named for Australian astronomer Walter F. Gale.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Mars is firmly in our sights,\" said NASA Administrator Charles Bolden. \"Curiosity not only will return a wealth of important science data, but it will serve as a precursor mission for human exploration to the Red Planet.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>During a prime mission lasting one Martian year -- nearly two Earth years -- researchers will use the rover's tools to study whether the landing region had favorable environmental conditions for supporting microbial life and for preserving clues about whether life ever existed. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Scientists identified Gale as their top choice to pursue the ambitious goals of this new rover mission,\" said Jim Green, director for the Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"The site offers a visually dramatic landscape and also great potential for significant science findings.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In 2006, more than 100 scientists began to consider about 30 potential landing sites during worldwide workshops. Four candidates were selected in 2008. An abundance of targeted images enabled thorough analysis of the safety concerns and scientific attractions of each site. A team of senior NASA science officials then conducted a detailed review and unanimously agreed to move forward with the MSL Science Team's recommendation. The team is comprised of a host of principal and co-investigators on the project. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity is about twice as long and more than five times as heavy as any previous Mars rover. Its 10 science instruments include two for ingesting and analyzing samples of powdered rock that the rover's robotic arm collects. A radioisotope power source will provide heat and electric power to the rover. A rocket-powered sky crane suspending Curiosity on tethers will lower the rover directly to the Martian surface. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The portion of the crater where Curiosity will land has an alluvial fan likely formed by water-carried sediments. The layers at the base of the mountain contain clays and sulfates, both known to form in water. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"One fascination with Gale is that it's a huge crater sitting in a very low-elevation position on Mars, and we all know that water runs downhill,\" said John Grotzinger, the mission's project scientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif. \"In terms of the total vertical profile exposed and the low elevation, Gale offers attractions similar to Mars' famous Valles Marineris, the largest canyon in the solar system.\" </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Curiosity will go beyond the \"follow-the-water\" strategy of recent Mars exploration. The rover's science payload can identify other ingredients of life, such as the carbon-based building blocks of biology called organic compounds. Long-term preservation of organic compounds requires special conditions. Certain minerals, including some Curiosity may find in the clay and sulfate-rich layers near the bottom of Gale's mountain, are good at latching onto organic compounds and protecting them from oxidation. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Gale gives us attractive possibilities for finding organics, but that is still a long shot,\" said Michael Meyer, lead scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program at agency headquarters. \"What adds to Gale's appeal is that, organics or not, the site holds a diversity of features and layers for investigating changing environmental conditions, some of which could inform a broader understanding of habitability on ancient Mars.\"  </p>\n",

      "</div>More than seven years into what was planned as a three-month mission on Mars, NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity has driven more than 20 miles, which is more than 50 times the mission's original distance goal.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />A drive of 407 feet (124 meters) completed on July 17 took Opportunity past the 20-mile mark (32.2 kilometers). It brought the rover to within a few drives of reaching the rim of Endeavour crater, the rover's team's long-term destination since mid-2008. Endeavour is about 14 miles (22 kilometers) in diameter, and its western rim exposes outcrops that record information older than any Opportunity has examined so far. The rover is now about eight-tenths of a mile (about 1.3 kilometers) from the site chosen for arriving at the rim.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />\"The numbers aren't really as important as the fact that driving so much farther than expected during this mission has put a series of exciting destinations within Opportunity's reach,\" said Alfonso Herrera, a rover mission manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. who has worked on the rover missions since before launch in 2003.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />The latest drive included an autonomous hazard detectionportion during which the rover paused at intervals to check for obstacles before proceeding.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />Herrera said, \"Autonomous hazard detection has added a significant portion of the driving distance over the past few months. It lets us squeeze 10 to 15 percent more distance into each drive.\"\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />The milestone-setting drive was on the 2,658th Martian day, or \"sol,\" of the rover's exploration of Mars. Opportunity drove backward. Backward driving is a technique to extend the life of a motor in the right-front wheel that sometimes draws more current than the other five wheels' drive motors.\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />JPL's Bill Nelson, chief of the mission's engineering team, said, \"Opportunity has an arthritic shoulder joint on her robotic arm and is a little lame in the right front wheel, but she is otherwise doing remarkably well after seven years on Mars -- more like 70 in 'rover years.'  The elevated right front wheel current is a concern, but a combination of heating and backwards driving has kept it in check over the past 2,000-plus sols.\"\n",
      "<br /> \n",
      "<br />Opportunity and its rover twin, Spirit, completed their three-month prime missions on Mars in April 2004. Both rovers continued for years of bonus, extended missions.

      "<p>They are the left and right eyes of the Mast Camera, or Mastcam, instrument on the Curiosity rover of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission, launching in late 2011. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The right-eye Mastcam looks through a telephoto lens, revealing details near or far with about three-fold better resolution than any previous landscape-viewing camera on the surface of Mars. The left-eye Mastcam provides broader context through a medium-angle lens. Each can acquire thousands of full-color images and store them in an eight-gigabyte flash memory. Both cameras are also capable of recording high-definition video at about eight frames per second. Combining information from the two eyes can yield 3-D views of the telephoto part of the scene.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Motivation to put telephoto capability in Curiosity's main science imaging instrument grew from experience with NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity and its studies of an arena-size crater in 2004. The science camera on that rover's mast, which can see details comparably to what a human eye can see at the same distance, showed intriguing patterns in the layers of Burns Cliff inside Endurance Crater. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"We tried to get over and study it, but the rover could not negotiate the steep slope,\" recalled Mastcam Principal Investigator Michael Malin, of Malin Space Science Systems, San Diego. \"We all desperately coveted a telephoto lens.\" NASA selected his Mastcam proposal later that year for the Mars Science Laboratory rover. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The telephoto Mastcam, called \"Mastcam 100\" for its 100-millimeter focal-length lens, provides enough resolution to distinguish a basketball from a football at a distance of seven football fields, or to read \"ONE CENT\" on a penny on the ground beside the rover. Its images cover an area about six degrees wide by five degrees tall.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Its left-eye partner, called \"Mastcam 34\" for its 34-millimeter lens, catches a scene three times wider -- about 18 degrees wide and 15 degrees tall -- with each exposure. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Researchers will use the Mastcams and nine other science instruments on Curiosity to study past and present environments in a carefully chosen area of Mars. They will assess whether conditions have been favorable for life and favorable for preserving evidence about whether life has existed there. Mastcam imaging of the shapes and colors of landscapes, rocks and soils will provide clues about the history of environmental processes that have formed them and modified them over time. Images and videos of the sky will document contemporary processes, such as movement of clouds and dust.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Previous color cameras on Mars have taken a sequence of exposures through different color filters to be combined on Earth into color views. The Mastcams record color the same way consumer digital cameras do: They have a grid of tiny red, green and blue squares (a \"Bayer pattern\" filter) fitted over the electronic light detector (the charge-coupled device, or CCD). This allows the Mastcams to get the three color components over the entire scene in a single exposure. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Mastcam's color-calibration target on the rover deck includes magnets to keep the highly magnetic Martian dust from accumulating on portions of color chips and white-gray-balance reference chips. Natural lighting on Mars tends to be redder than on Earth due to dust in Mars' atmosphere. \"True color\" images can be produced that incorporate that lighting effect -- comparable to the greenish look of color-film images taken under fluorescent lights on Earth without a white-balancing adjustment. A white-balance calculation can yield a more natural look by adjusting for the tint of the lighting, as the human eye tends to do and digital cameras can do. The Mastcams are capable of producing both true-color and white-balanced images.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Besides the affixed red-green-blue filter grid, the Mastcams have wheels of other filters that can be rotated into place between the lens and the CCD.  These include science spectral filters for examining the ground or sky in narrow bands of visible-light or near-infrared wavelengths. One filter on each camera allows it to look directly at the sun to measure the amount of dust in the atmosphere, a key part of Mars' weather.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Something we're likely to do frequently is to look at rocks and features with the Mastcam 34 red-green-blue filter, and if we see something of interest, follow that up with the Mastcam 34 and Mastcam 100 science spectral filters,\" Malin said. \"We can use the red-green-blue data for quick reconnaissance and the science filters for target selection.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When Curiosity drives to a new location, Mastcam 34 can record a full-color, full-circle panorama about 60 degrees tall by taking 150 images in about 25 minutes. Using Mastcam 100, the team will be able to broaden the swath of terrain evaluated on either side of the path Curiosity drives, compared to what has been possible with earlier Mars rovers. That will help with selection of the most interesting targets to approach for analysis by Curiosity's other instruments and will provide additional geological context for interpreting data about the chosen targets.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The Mastcams will provide still images and video to study motions of the rover -- both for science, such as seeing how soils interact with wheels, and for engineering, such as aiding in use of the robotic arm. In other videos, the team may use cinematic techniques such as panning across a scene and using the rover's movement for \"dolly\" shots.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Each of the two-megapixel Mastcams can take and store thousands of images, though the amount received on Earth each day will depend on how the science team chooses priorities for the day's available data-transmission volume. Malin anticipates frequent use of Mastcam \"thumbnail\" frames -- compressed roughly 150-by-150-pixel versions of each image -- as an index of the full-scale images held in the onboard memory.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Malin Space Science Systems built the Mastcam instrument and will operate it.

NASA changed the plan to two different fixed-focal-length cameras in 2007 as a cost-cutting measure that preserves the capability for meeting the science goals of the mission and the instrument. The agency funded a renewed possibility for using the zoom-camera design in 2010, but the zoom development presented challenges that could not be fully overcome with enough time for required testing on the rover.</p>\n",

There is a continued silence from the Gusev site on Mars.</p>\n",

      "<p>Spirit was designed as a 3-month mission with a kilometer of traverse capability.  The rover lasted over 6 years and drove over 7.7 kilometers [4.8 miles] and returned over 124,000 images.  Importantly, it is not how long the rover lasted, but how much exploration and discovery Spirit has done.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This is a rover that faced continuous challenges and had to fight for every discovery.  Nothing came easy for Spirit.  When she landed, she had the Sol 18 flash memory anomaly that threatened her survival.  Scientifically, Mars threw a curveball.  What was to be a site for lakebed sediments at Gusev, turned out to be a plain of volcanic material as far as the rover eye could see.  So Spirit dashed across the plains in an attempt to reach the distant Columbia Hills, believed to be more ancient than the plains.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>It was after her second Earth year on Mars when Spirit descended down the other side of the Columbia Hills that she experienced the first major failure of the mission, her right-front wheel failed.  Spirit had to re-learn to drive with just five wheels, driving mostly backwards dragging her failed wheel.  It is out of this failure that Spirit made one of the most significant discoveries of the mission.  Out of lemons, Spirit made lemonade.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Each winter was hard for Spirit.  But with ever-accumulating dust and the failed wheel that limited the maximum achievable slope, Spirit had no options for surviving the looming fourth winter.  So we made a hard push toward some high-value science to the south.  But the first path there, up onto Home Plate, was not passable.  So we went for Plan B, around to the northeast of Home Plate.  That too was not passable and the clock was ticking.  We were left with our last choice, the longest and most risky, to head around Home Plate to the west.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>It was along this path that Spirit, with her degraded 5-wheel driving, broke through an unseen hazard and became embedded in unconsolidated fine material that trapped the rover.  Even this unfortunate event turned into another exciting scientific discovery.  We conducted a very ambitious extrication effort, but the extrication on Mars ran out of time with the fourth winter and was further complicated by another wheel failure.</p>\n",

      "<p>With no favorable tilt and more dust on the arrays, Spirit likely ran out of energy and succumbed to the cold temperatures during the fourth winter.  There was a plausible expectation that the rover might survive the cold and wake up in the spring, but a lack of response from the rover after more than 1,200 recovery commands were sent to rouse her indicates that Spirit will sleep forever. <div class='image_module right' style=''>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>Spirit last communicated on March 22, 2010, as Martian winter approached and the rover's solar-energy supply declined. The rover operated for more than six years after landing in January 2004 for what was planned as a three-month mission. NASA checked frequently in recent months for possible reawakening of Spirit as solar energy available to the rover increased during Martian spring. A series of additional re-contact attempts ended today, designed for various possible combinations of recoverable conditions.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Our job was to wear these rovers out exploring, to leave no unutilized capability on the surface of Mars, and for Spirit, we have done that,\" said Mars Exploration Rover Project Manager John Callas of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Spirit drove 4.8 miles (7.73 kilometers), more than 12 times the goal set for the mission. The drives crossed a plain to reach a distant range of hills that appeared as mere bumps on the horizon from the landing site; climbed slopes up to 30 degrees as Spirit became the first robot to summit a hill on another planet; and covered more than half a mile (nearly a kilometer) after Spirit's right-front wheel became immobile in 2006. The rover returned more than 124,000 images. It ground the surfaces off 15 rock targets and scoured 92 targets with a brush to prepare the targets for inspection with spectrometers and a microscopic imager. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"What's really important is not only how long Spirit worked or how far Spirit drove, but also how much exploration and scientific discovery Spirit accomplished,\" Callas said.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>One major finding came, ironically, from dragging the inoperable right-front wheel as the rover was driving backwards in 2007. That wheel plowed up bright white soil. Spirit's Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer and Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer revealed that the bright material was nearly pure silica.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"Spirit's unexpected discovery of concentrated silica deposits was one of the most important findings by either rover,\" said Steve Squyres of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., principal investigator for Spirit and Opportunity. \"It showed that there were once hot springs or steam vents at the Spirit site, which could have provided favorable conditions for microbial life.\"</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The silica-rich soil neighbors a low plateau called Home Plate, which was Spirit's main destination after the historic climb up Husband Hill. \"What Spirit showed us at Home Plate was that early Mars could be a violent place, with water and hot rock interacting to make what must have been spectacular volcanic explosions. It was a dramatically different world than the cold, dry Mars of today,\" said Squyres.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The trove of data from Spirit could still yield future science revelations. Years of analysis of some 2005 observations by the rover's Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer, Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer and Moessbauer Spectrometer produced a report last year that an outcrop on Husband Hill bears a high concentration of carbonate. This is evidence of a wet, non-acidic ancient environment that may have been favorable for microbial life.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>\"What's most remarkable to me about Spirit's mission is just how extensive her accomplishments became,\" said Squyres. \"What we initially conceived as a fairly simple geologic experiment on Mars ultimately turned into humanity's first real overland expedition across another planet. Spirit explored just as we would have, seeing a distant hill, climbing it, and showing us the vista from the summit. And she did it in a way that allowed everyone on Earth to be part of the adventure.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>The proposed Mars lander would carry three experiments. A seismometer for measuring Mars quakes would yield knowledge about interior materials from the crust to the core. A thermal probe beneath the surface would monitor heat flow from the planet's interior. Radio capability for Doppler tracking of tiny variations in the planet's wobble would provide information about the size and nature of the core. Understanding more about the deep interior of another planet would enable important new comparisons with what is known about Earth's interior. \r\n",

      "<p>-- Primitive Material Explorer (PriME) would develop a mass spectrometer that would provide highly precise measurements of the chemical composition of a comet and explore the objects' role in delivering volatiles to Earth. Anita Cochran of the University of Texas in Austin is principal investigator. </p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>-- Whipple: Reaching into the Outer Solar System would develop and validate a technique called blind occultation that could lead to the discovery of various celestial objects in the outer solar system and revolutionize our understanding of the area's structure.

Additional evidence came from correlating the deposit to visible sublimation features typical of dry ice.</p>\n",

      "<p>An occasional increase in the atmosphere would strengthen winds, lofting more dust and leading to more frequent and more intense dust storms. Another result is an expanded area on the planet's surface where liquid water could persist without boiling. Modeling based on known variation in the tilt of Mars' axis suggests several-fold changes in the total mass of the planet's atmosphere can happen on time frames of 100,000 years or less. </p>\n",

      "<p>The changes in atmospheric density caused by the carbon-dioxide increase also would amplify some effects of the changes caused by the tilt. Researchers plugged the mass of the buried carbon-dioxide deposit into climate models for the period when Mars' tilt and orbital properties maximize the amount of summer sunshine hitting the south pole.
